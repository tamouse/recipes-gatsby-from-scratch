Nothing beats the taste of real maple syrup. However, we can't always
afford it or find it. But there's usually mapleline available, and it
makes a serviceable syrup for pancakes if you do it right.



## Ingredients

* 1 cup water
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/4 tsp mapleline
* 1/4 tsp almond extract


## Directions

1.  bring water to a rolling boil

1.  add the sugar and stir it until it dissolves

1.  add the mapleline and almond extract


## Comments

See, the secret is the almond extract. Without it, the mapleline
flavour tastes a bit metalic and dull.
