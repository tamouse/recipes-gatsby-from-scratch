Found in the Taste section of the Minneapolis Star/Tribune, October
2011, originally from the "Apple Lover's Cookbook". My friend, Marina,
makes a version of this without apples, and tops with powdered sugar
and lemon juice as well. This is their traditional holiday breakfast
dish.



## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup flour
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 5 eggs (use fewer if using jumbo eggs)
* 1 cup whole or 2 percent milk
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 1/2 large, firm apples (such as Honeycrisp or Sweet Tango), peeled, cored and cut into 1/8th inch rings
* Powdered sugar and lemon wedges for garnish


## Directions

1. Set rack in middle of oven and Heat oven to 425 degrees F.

1. In medium bowl, sift flour then stir in sugar, cinnamon and salt.

1. In large bowl, whisk eggs and milk until mixture is frothy and
   drizzles from whisk in a thin stream, about 1 minute

1. In a 12-inch cast iron or other heavy bottomed skillet over medium
heat, melt butter. Lay apple slices in butter in a single layer and
cook, without stirring, for 2 minutes. Gently flip slices and cook
for another 2 minutes until tender.

1. Working quickly, add the flour mixture to egg mixture and whisk just
to combine. Pour batter into hot skillet with apples, then transfer
the skillet to the oven. Bake until pancake is puffed and golden,
about 10 to 14 minutes.

1. Remove skillet from oven and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

1. Serve immediately from skillet, with lemon wedges to squirt over the top.
