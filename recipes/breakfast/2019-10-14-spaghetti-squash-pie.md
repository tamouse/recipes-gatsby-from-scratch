This sounds yummy, and bonus gluten-free and dairy-free.

Serves about 6.

## Ingredients

- 1 large spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
- 1 pound ground turkey sausage
- 1/2 cup diced onion
- 1 cup pizza sauce
- 1 cup coarsely chopped baby spinach leaves
- 1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 eggs, beaten

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Line a baking sheet big enough to hold both halves of the squash with aluminum foil.
2. Place spaghetti squash, cut-side down, on the baking sheet.
3. Bake squash  until cooked through, for about 25 minutes, and remove from oven.
5. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. When cool enough to handle, scoop out the strands of squash with a spoon and place in an 8-inch square baking dish.
5. Heat up a large skillet to medium heat, add some oil when the pan is hot.
6. Cook the onion and bell pepper until soft.
7. Add the turkey sausage, busting it up and stirring it with the onion and pepper until it browns.
7. Remove from heat and stir in the spaghetti sauce, chopped spinach, applesauce, basil, garlic powder, oregano, and black pepper into turkey mixture.
8. Spread mixture over squash in baking dish.
9. Pour eggs over turkey mixture and toss the egg, turkey mixture, and squash together until the egg is just combined.
10. Bake for about an hour, until the  mixture is bubbling and eggs are set.
11. Remove from oven and let set before serving.


This would be great with mixed fruit and GF muffins for breakfast.
