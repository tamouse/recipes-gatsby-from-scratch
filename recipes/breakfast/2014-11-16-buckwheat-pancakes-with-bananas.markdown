Buckwheat pancakes made with real buckwheat flour are gluten free.


## Ingredients

* 1 cup buckwheat flour
* 1 Tbsp brown sugar
* 2 Tbsp potato starch
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 cup rice milk
* 2 Tbsp canola oil
* Vegetable cooking spray, for frying
* 2 large bananas, sliced
* Brown rice syrup, to serve

#### Directions

1.  Combine dry ingredients in a medium bowl. Add rice milk and canola oil, and whisk until well combined. If batter seems very thick, you may want add a little extra rice milk or water.

1.  Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Spray with vegetable cooking spray.

2.  With a ladle, pour batter to the size you prefer. Even out batter on skillet with back of a spoon. Cook pancake on medium high heat for a few minutes until bubbles appear. Flip over and continue frying until cooked (a properly cooked pancake appears dense and not sticky when cut in the middle).

3.  Repeat previous step until batter is gone.

4.  Serve pancakes with banana slices and brown rice syrup.
