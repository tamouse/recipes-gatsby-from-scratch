I have yet to try this, but it looks just *too* easy.


Ingredients
-----------


-   1 egg yolk (about 30 grams)
-   1 teaspoon water (about 10 grams)
-   1 teaspoon lemon juice from 1 lemon (about 10 grams)
-   Kosher salt
-   1 stick butter (8 tablespoons, about 112 grams)
-   Pinch cayenne pepper or hot sauce (if desired)

Procedures
----------

1.  Combine egg yolk, water, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt in the
    bottom of a cup that barely fits the head of an immersion blender.
    Melt butter in a small saucepan over high heat, swirling constantly,
    until foaming subsides. Transfer butter to a 1 cup liquid measuring
    cup.

2.  Place head of immersion blender into the bottom of the cup and turn
    it on. With the blender constantly running, slowly pour hot butter
    into cup. It should emulsify with the egg yolk and lemon juice.
    Continue pouring until all butter is added. Sauce should be thick
    and creamy. Season to taste with salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper
    or hot sauce (if desired). Serve immediately, or transfer to a small
    lidded pot and keep in a warm place for up to 1 hour before serving.
    Hollandaise cannot be cooled and reheated.
