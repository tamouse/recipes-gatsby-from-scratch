I wanted something that was gluten-free and dairy-free to snack on one evening, and didn't really want popcorn, my typical go-to these days, and thought "Hey, I have some tortilla chips, I have a couple cans of beans, why not make some bean dip?". So I did.

## Ingredients

- 2 15oz. cans of beans, rinsed and drained. I used one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans, you do you.
- 1 15oz. can of diced tomatoes, drained.
- 1 small can green chilis.
- salt and pepper
- ground cumin
- chili powder
- red pepper flakes
- chipotle seasoning

## Directions

1. get out food processor and set it up.

2. find out food processor was put away filthy. take apart food processor and wash thoroughly, dry, and set up again.

3. open up all the cans.

4. wash and rinse one can of beans at a time, or like i did, dump both cans in the strainer and find out it's too big and spills beans all over when doing the next step.

5. dump the washed and rinsed beans in the food processor.

6. drain the tomatoes, and dump into the food processor.

7. dump in the green chilis. (you can see where this is heading, i think).

8. add the seasonings and spices that you see fit. this is what was in the spice rack.

9. pulse to stir up the ingredients, then run for a few seconds to mess up that dip.

10. realize this makes way more than you as a single eater can manage to eat in a lifetime. freeze the rest to save for that big gathering happening at the end of the month. they'll eat it, sure.

11. soak the food processor parts overnight and thoroughly clean that puppy.
