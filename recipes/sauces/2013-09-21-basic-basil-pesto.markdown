Pesto has many uses, such as with pasta, topping for chicken or fish,
or as a spread on crusty Italian bread. This is a pretty basic recipe,
found all over.



## Ingredients
* 2 cups fresh basil, washed and stemmed.
* 2 large cloves of garlic, pealed.
* 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan and/or romano cheese
* 1/4 cup pine nuts or walnuts
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper.


## Directions

1.  In a food processor, pulse basil, garlic, cheese and nuts to chop and combine.

1.  Slowly pour olive oil in while processor is running.

1.  Salt and pepper to taste.


I freeze this in 3 oz servings in zip-lock baggies.
