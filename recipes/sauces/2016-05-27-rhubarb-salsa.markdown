My cousin found this in the StarTrib and rushed off to the library to
copy it down since they don't subscribe. It was a really beautiful
accompaniment to the salmon he grilled up for lunch.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb. rhubarb, about 5 to 6 medium stalks
* 1/2 jalape√±o pepper, seeded and deveined, finely chopped, to taste
* 2 tbsp. fresh lime juice
* 2 tbsp. honey or sugar, or to taste
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 1/2 c. chopped fresh cilantro
* 1 tbsp. chopped fresh mint

## Directions

1. Trim the stem end of the rhubarb. Cut the rhubarb into 1/4-inch pieces.
2. Place the rhubarb, pepper and lime juice into a saucepan and set over medium heat.
3. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover and simmer until the rhubarb is just tender.
4. Remove from the heat.
5. Sweeten with honey or sugar, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Toss in the cilantro and mint.
7. Cool before serving.

## Notes

Makes about 1 cup.

This is lightly cooked to retain the bold flavors of tangy rhubarb and hot pepper. For a tamer salsa, use a milder Anaheim pepper instead.

Serve this with chips, on a turkey burger or over fish tacos.

It will keep in a covered container for several days in the refrigerator.
