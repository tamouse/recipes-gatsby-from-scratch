## Ingredients

**Ensure these are all gluten-free and dairy-free.**

* 1 (12 ounce) bottle of chili sauce
* 1 tablespoon of tomato paste
* 1/3 cup of ketchup
* 3/4 cup of brown sugar
* 10 turns of the pepper grinder
* 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger, optional
* 1/2 teaspoon of Creole or Cajun seasoning
* 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon of dry mustard
* 1/4 teaspoon of turmeric
* 1/4 teaspoon of onion salt
* 1/4 teaspoon of garlic salt
* 1/2 teaspoon of yellow mustard
* 1/2 teaspoon of hot sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon of Kitchen Bouquet
* 1/2 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon of Liquid Smoke
* 1 teaspoon of soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons of pure cane syrup

## Directions

1. Whisk together all of the ingredients.

## Cook's Notes:

This makes about 1-1/2 cups of sauce, so increase ingredients as
needed. Add two tablespoons to 1/4 cup of Maker's Mark or Jack
Daniels, for variety. May also substitute pure maple syrup, sorghum
syrup, or molasses, loosened with a bit of corn syrup in place of the
cane syrup. A small can of tomato sauce, additional ketchup or a
combination of the two may be substituted for the chili sauce.
