A creamy, cheesy sauce to go over pasta or other things.

This starts with your basic [white sauce] and adds parmesan. Couldn't be easier, really!

## Ingredients

* 1 cup of [white sauce]
* 1/2 cup parmesan cheese

## Directions

1.  Make the [white sauce] according to the directions

1.  Before the sauce thickens too much, add the parmesan cheese. Stir until desired thickness/texture emerges.
