From Martha Stewart, this looks super tasty.

Ingredients
-----------

### For the Crust

-   1 disk [Cheddar Pie Dough]
-   All-purpose flour, for surface
-   1 large egg, lightly beaten for egg wash
-   Coarse sanding sugar, for sprinkling

### For the Filling

-   2 tart apples, such as Granny Smith or Gala, plus 2 McIntosh apples,
    peeled, cored, and sliced into 1/2-inch wedges
-   1/2 cup granulated sugar
-   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
-   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
-   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   1/4 cup apricot preserves, warmed

Directions
----------

1.  Make the crust: Roll out dough to a 13-inch round, about 1/8 inch
    thick, on a lightly floured surface. Transfer to a parchment-lined
    baking sheet. Refrigerate for 20 minutes.

2.  Make the filling: Toss together apples, granulated sugar, flour,
    lemon juice, and cinnamon.

3.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spread filling over dough, leaving a 1
    1/2-inch border. Fold edges in to form a crust; brush with egg wash,
    and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Refrigerate until edges are firm,
    about 30 minutes.

4.  Bake crostata until apples are tender and crust is golden, about 1
    hour 20 minutes. Let cool slightly. Brush apples with apricot
    preserves.
