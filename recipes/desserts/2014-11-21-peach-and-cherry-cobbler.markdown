Cobblers are dead-easy, better than pies. Here's one coming from Panera bread.


Ingredients
-----------

-   3 tablespoons butter
-   1/4 cup all-purpose flour
-   1/3 cup sugar
-   1 teaspoon baking powder
-   1/4 teaspoon salt

-   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   1/4 cup low-fat buttermilk
-   1/4 teaspoon almond extract
-   1 cup sliced fresh (or frozen and thawed) peaches
-   1 cup pitted fresh (or frozen and thawed) sour cherries

-   3 tablespoons butter
-   1/4 cup all-purpose flour
-   1/3 cup sugar
-   1 teaspoon baking powder
-   1/4 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   1/4 cup low-fat buttermilk
-   1/4 teaspoon almond extract
-   1 cup sliced fresh (or frozen and thawed) peaches
-   1 cup pitted fresh (or frozen and thawed) sour cherries

Directions
----------

### Step 1.

Heat the oven to 350&deg;F. Put the butter in a 9-inch pie pan or shallow
2-quart baking dish. Put the pan in the oven until the butter melts,
about 5 minutes.

### Step 2.

Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, 1/4 cup of the
sugar, the baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. In a cup, whisk together
the buttermilk and almond extract. Pour the mixture into the dry
ingredients, and whisk just until moistened, leaving a few lumps.

### Step 3.

Add the batter to the pan with the melted butter and stir to combine.
Scatter the peaches and cherries on top and sprinkle with the remaining
sugar.

### Step 4.

Bake until the cobbler is browned around the edges and a toothpick
inserted in its center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.

Tip: Save time by using frozen peaches and cherries.
