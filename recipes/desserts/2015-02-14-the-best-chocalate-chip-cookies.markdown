Makes about 6 dozen cookies.

Note: Rolled oats are also known as old fashioned oats. In place of
butterscotch chips, consider adding 1 cup of toasted, chopped pecans
in place. (To toast pecans, preheat oven to 325 degrees. Spread pecans
in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet and bake, stirring
occasionally, until they are fragrant and toasted, about 10
minutes. Remove from oven, let cool, coarsely chop, and reserve.) From
Scott Rohr of St. Paul.
