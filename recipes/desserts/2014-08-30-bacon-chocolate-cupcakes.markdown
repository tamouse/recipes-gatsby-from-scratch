Dark chocolate, bacon, cupcakes. 'Nuff said.


## Ingredients

* 12 slices bacon
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
*  3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 2 cups white sugar
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup cold, strong, brewed coffee
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place bacon in a
large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly
brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.

2. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, 3/4 cup cocoa powder,
sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Make a well in the center
and pour in the eggs, coffee, buttermilk and oil. Stir just until
blended. Mix in 3/4 of the bacon, reserving the rest for garnish. Spoon
the batter into the prepared cups, dividing evenly. 

3. Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly
pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pan set over a wire rack. When
cool, arrange the cupcakes on a serving platter. Frost with your
favorite chocolate frosting and sprinkle reserved bacon crumbles on
top. Dust with additional cocoa powder.
