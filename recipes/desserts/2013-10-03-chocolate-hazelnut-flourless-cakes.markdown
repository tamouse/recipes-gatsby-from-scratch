These chocolate treats are crowd-pleasers, and they're gluten-free.

## Ingredients

-   Nonstick cooking spray
-   6 Tbsp unsalted butter
-   6 oz milk chocolate chips
-   2 oz chocolate-hazelnut spread (Nutella, who are we kidding??)
-   6 large eggs, separated
-   3/4 cup sugar
-   Whipped cream, for serving
-   Chopped hazelnuts, for serving

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 325&deg;F. Mist 8 (7-oz) ramekins with cooking spray.

2.  Combine butter, chocolate chips, and chocolate-hazelnut spread in a
    large, microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second increments,
    stirring each time, until completely melted. (Or melt mixture in
    bowl set over a saucepan with 2 inches simmering water, whisking
    constantly.) Let cool slightly. Whisk in egg yolks 1 at a time.

3.  Put egg whites in a large bowl. Whisk by hand or beat with an
    electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until stiff peaks
    form. Add sugar. Beat until glossy.

4.  Mix half of egg whites into chocolate mixture, then fold in
    remaining whites. Divide mixture among ramekins.

5.  Bake until cakes pull away from sides, 35 to 45 minutes. Serve warm
    with whipped cream and hazelnuts.
