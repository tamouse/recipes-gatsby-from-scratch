Pretty good looking and easy recipe from Panera

## Ingredients


- 1.5 pounds Granny Smith apples (about 3 small), peeled, halved, and sliced
- 3/4 cup fresh or frozen cranberries
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons + 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup shelled pistachios
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pieces


## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 375&deg;F. Coat a 2-quart baking dish (an 8-by-8-inch size works well) with cooking spray or butter.

2. In a large bowl, toss together the apples, cranberries, granulated sugar, lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons of flour. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish.

3. In a food processor, combine the pistachios, brown sugar, oats, cinnamon, salt, butter, and remaining 1/2 cup of flour. Pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

4. Spread the topping over the fruit and bake until golden brown and bubbly, 35 to 45 minutes.


## Tips

If you donâ€™t have pistachios, use pecans, walnuts, or almonds instead.
