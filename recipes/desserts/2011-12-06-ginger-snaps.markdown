This is a recipe from my Great Aunt Lillian's store of recipes, has
been in my family for a long time. These are the best ginger snaps
**evar**.


## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup shortening
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 egg
* 4 tablespoons molasses
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 2 cups flour
* 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg



## Directions

1.  Mix ingredients together. **Do not overbeat!** Chill dough for at least 2 hours or overnight.

1.  Heat oven to  350&degF;

1.  Shape dough into little balls (about 1" diameter) and roll in sugar. (This is why the dough must be chilled.)

1.  Lay out balls on cookie sheet with at least 1.5 inches between them.

1.  Bake at 350&degF; for 10 to 12 minutes. Be careful they don't burn!

1.  Cool cookies on a rack.

Makes about 60 cookies. These freeze well.


One batch will go nicely in the food processor.
