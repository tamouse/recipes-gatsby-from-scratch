The classic Betty Crocker cake, using a spring-form pan instead of the cast-iron skillet, because I have one and not the other.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup softened butter, divided
* 1 cup brown sugar
* &frac12; teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 20-ounce can of pineapple slices, drained, with 1 cup of juice reserved
* &frac12; jar of marasshino cherries
* 1 18&frac14; ounce boxed yellow cake mix
* 2 eggs
* &frac12; cup shredded coconum


## Directions

1.  Heat oven to 350&degF;.

1.  Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
1.  Wrap a double layer of foil inside and over the lip of a 10-inch springform pan.

1.  Place &frac12; cup butter in pan and heat in the oven for 2 minutes; remove.
1.  Stir in sugar and ginger.
1.  Arrange pineapple slices in the pan and place &frac12; a maraschino cherry in the center of each ring.

1.  Beat cake mix, &frac12; cup butter, eggs, and reserved pineapple juice on medium for 2 minutes.
1.  Stir in coconut.
1.  Spoon the batter into the springform pan.
1.  Place the pan on the baking sheet, centering it.

1.  Bake for 55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.
1.  Remove from oven and cool for at least 5 minutes.
1.  Loosen the springform pan and invert the cake onto a serving platter.
