## Ingredients

###  For the cakes

* &frac13; cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for the pan
* &frac12; cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
* &frac14; cup Dutch-process cocoa powder
* &frac14; teaspoon kosher salt
* &frac18; teaspoon baking soda
* &frac12; cup sugar
* 1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk
* &frac12; teaspoon vanilla extract
* &frac12; teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
* 6 fresh figs, halved

###  For the glaze

* 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
* 2 teaspoons honey, plus more for drizzling
* 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
* Large pinch of kosher salt
* &frac12; teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper, plus more for topping


## Directions

### Make the cakes

1.  Heat oven to 350&degF;.

1.  Brush a 6-cup muffin pan with olive oil and dust with flour.

1.  Whisk the cocao powder and &frac14; cup hot water in a small bowl; let cool slightly.

1.  Combine the flour, salt and baking soda in another bowl.

1.  Combine the sugar, egg and egg yolk, vanilla, and lemon zest in a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment and beat on medium-high speed until pale and thick, about 1 minute.

1.  With the mixer running, drizzle in the olive oil.

1.  Add the cocoa mixture and beat until combined.

1.  Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture and beat until just incorporated.

1.  Divide the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups.

1.  Bake for 10 minutes at 350&degF;, then top each cake with a fig half and continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs, 8 to 10 more minutes. Let cool in the pan on a rack for 20 minutes. Remove cakes from pan and let cool completely on the rack.

### Make the glaze

* Put the chocolate, honey, olive oil, salt and pepper in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth.

### Serve

* Top the cakes with the glaze, a drizzle of honey and more pepper. Quarter the remaining fig halves and arrange on top.
