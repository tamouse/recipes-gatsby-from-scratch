Yield: 4 apple halves

## Ingredients

-   35 grams rolled oats (1/3 cup)
-   35 grams all purpose flour (1/4 cup)
-   30 grams fine raw sugar (2 tablespoons) or brown sugar
-   1 gram salt (1/4 teaspoon)
-   43 grams unsalted butter (3 tablespoons), cut into small pieces
-   1 teaspoon of ice water + more if needed
-   100 grams fresh ripe dates
-   1 teaspoon tapioca starch (sometimes called tapioca flour)
-   1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
-   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   28 grams unsalted butter (2 tablespoons) melted
-   2 very large apples (about 420 grams each)

## Directions

1.  Put the oven rack in the middle position and preheat to 190 C (375
    F).

2.  Add the rolled oats, flour, sugar and salt to the bowl of a small
    food processor and pulse a few times to break up the oats.

3.  Add the butter and pulse 1 second at a time until the mixture looks
    like a fine gravel.

4.  Add the ice water and pulse until the mixture looks like a coarse
    gravel that’s barely coming together. Add a bit more water if
    needed.

5.  Place the topping in the freezer while you work on the filling.

6.  Remove the pits from the dates. The dates should be the consistency
    of a soft caramel. If you’re using dried dates, you may need to soak
    them in some boiling water for a few minutes to soften them up.

7.  Mash the dates together with the tapioca starch, nutmeg, cinnamon,
    and melted butter.

8.  Cut the apples in half from top to bottom and use a metal measuring
    spoon or melon scoop to remove the core. After the apple halves are
    cored, continue carving pieces of apple out and add the pieces to
    the date mixture. You want to leave at least 1 cm (1/3-inch) of
    apple around the skin so that the apple holds its shape while being
    baked.

9.  Mix the date mixture and apples together until they are well combine
    and then divide the mixture into the apples.

10. Take the topping mixture out of the freezer and top each apple with
    it.

11. Place the stuffed apples on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake
    until the apples are soft and the topping is golden brown (about
    35-45 minutes).
