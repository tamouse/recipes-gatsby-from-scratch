I've not made this, but the recipe sounds wonderful.


## Ingredients
* 2 cup flour
* 3/4 cup finely ground walnut halves
* 2/3 cup sugar, divided
* 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt or sea salt
* 3/4 teaspoon rubbed sage
* 1 cup cold, unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
* 1 cup cherry or strawberry preserves
* 12 ounce bag fresh cranberries
* 2 teaspoon cherry Herring, kirsch, or other cherry liqueur
* 1/2 cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese


## Directions

1.  Heat oven to 350&degF;.

1.  In a food processor, combine flour, ground walnuts, 1/3 cup sugar, salt, and sage. Pulse to incorportate.

1.  Add butter, pulse to form a coarse meal, 30 seconds or less.

1.  With your fingers, press meal into an ungreased 10-inch spring-form pan or fluted pan.

1.  Bake until light golden-brown, about 55 minutes.

1.  Cool completely and release from springform pan.

1.  In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, cook cherry preserves until melted.

1.  Add cranberries, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and cherry liqueur.

1.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, until cranberries have lost their shape, about 25 minutes.

1.  Remove from heat and let cool completely, about 1 hour.

1.  Crumble gorgonzola over crust in an even layer.

1.  Top with a thin layer of cranberry mixture.

Serve as an appetizer, side dish, or dessert.

I'm quite unsure what they mean by "thin layer of cranberry mixture" -- a 12 ounce bag is going to make a fair bit of sauce, I'm assuming a thin layer is like enough to get a whole set of berries on top in a single layer. I guess you just serve up the rest of the cranberries alone.

The recipe also does not say how long to let the final tart sit to set. I'd guess at least an hour or two.
