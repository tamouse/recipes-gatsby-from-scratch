These look delectable, but I have yet to try the recipe. I'm not at
all sure about using butter substitute here, why not just use the real
thing? Also: too many brand names here.

## Ingredients

-  1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
-  1 Crisco® Baking Sticks Butter Flavor All-Vegetable Shortening cut
   into slices
-  OR 1 cup Crisco® Butter Flavor All-Vegetable Shortening
-  3 large eggs separated
-  2 tablespoons water
-  1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
-  1/4 teaspoon salt
-  1 3/4 cups Pillsbury BEST® All Purpose Flour
-  1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
-  2 cups finely chopped pecans
-  1/2 cup Smucker's® Caramel Flavored Topping

### Directions

1.  HEAT oven to 350°F. Adjust rack to middle position. Coat two baking
    sheets lightly with no-stick cooking spray.

2.  BEAT brown sugar and shortening in medium bowl with an electric
    mixer at medium speed for 2 minutes or until fluffy. Scrape down
    sides of bowl. Add egg yolks, water, vanilla and salt. Beat until
    well combined. Add flour and cocoa on low speed until well blended.

3.  BEAT egg whites in a shallow bowl until foamy. Place pecans in a
    separate shallow bowl. Measure about 2 teaspoons dough for each
    cookie. Form into balls. Dip each dough ball into egg whites, then
    roll into pecans. Place on prepared baking sheet. Using the back of
    teaspoon or your thumb, make a rounded indentation in the top of
    each cookie.

4.  BAKE 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Make indentation in cookie again.
    Place 1/2 teaspoon caramel topping into indentation of each cookie.
    Bake an additional 5 to 7 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove
    from oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for several
    minutes. Remove to cooling rack to cool completely.
