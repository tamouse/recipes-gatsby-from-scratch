a tasty sounding treat reminiscent of s'mores



## Ingredients

###  For the bars

* 1.5 cups broken pretzel pieces
* 1.25 cups all-purpose flour
* 1.5 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 stick unsalted butter
* 1.5 cups packed light brown sugar
* 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

###  For the topping

* 8 marshmallows, halved crosswise
* 0.25 cup peanut butter chips
* 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, halved
* 0.25 cup semisweet chocolate chips


## Directions
1.  Position rack in the middle of oven and heat to 350&degF;.

1.  Line a 9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides. Lightly spray the foil with cooking spray.

1.  Pulse 1 cup of pretzel pieces in a food processor until finely ground (yields about 1/2 cup crumbs). Transfer to a bowl and whisk in flour, baking powder and salt.

1.  Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in brown sugar. Let cool slightly, then stir in eggs and vanilla.

1.  Stir in the pretzel crumb mixture to the butter mixture in two additions.

1.  Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Scatter the remaining pretzel pieces evenly on top.

1.  Bake until golden and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool completely in the pan on a rack.

1.  Turn the oven on to broil.

1.  Lift the bars in the foil out of the pan and transfer to a baking sheet.

1.  Press the marshmallow halves, cut side down, in even rows on top of the bars.

1.  Broil, rotating the sheet to ensure even browning of the marshmallow pieces, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and let cool.

1.  Place peanut butter chips and 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil in a microwave safe bowl and microwave on high for 30 second intervals, stirring, until chips are fully melted.

1.  Repeat with chocolate chips in a separate bowl.

1.  Drizzle melted peanut butter and chocolate mixtures over the bars.

1.  Let harden at room temperature or chilled before cutting bars.
