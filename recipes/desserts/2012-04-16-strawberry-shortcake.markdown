Shortcakes used here are really just slightly modified drop biscuits. Nothing special here, really.

## Shortcakes

### Ingredients

* 1.25 cups bisquick, or other biscuit mix
* 1/3 cup milk, more or less
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon


### Directions
1.  Heat oven to 450&degF;.

1.  Combine bisquick, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon, stir until just mixed, don't over beat. Dough will be rather sticky.

1.  Drop dough onto baking sheet, the amounts given should make 3 good sized biscuits. Flatten a little bit.

1.  Bake for 10-12 minutes until biscuits are light brown.

## Topping

Fresh strawberries in season cannot be beat. I like a lot of strawberries, usually using one of the 2-pint containers for this.

### Ingredients

* Fresh strawberries
* Sweetener (plain sugar works great, but other sweeteners can work as well)

### Directions

1.  Wash strawberries thoroughly

1.  Remove stems and chop into 1/4" dice

1.  Mix sweetener of choice over cut up strawberries

1.  Let chill for an hour or so

## Assembly

1.  Slice each biscuit in half horizontally. Arrange bottoms on serving plates.

1.  Cover each bottom with plenty of strawberries.

1.  Spritz on some whipped cream.

1.  Place biscuit top over whipped cream.

1.  Spritz on more whipped cream.

1.  Sprinkle more berries on top.

1.  Serve.
