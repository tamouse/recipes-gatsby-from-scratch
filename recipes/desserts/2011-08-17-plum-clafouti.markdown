A yummy fruit cobbler type of dessert. This recipe is adapted from King Arthur Flour's "The Baking Companion."

Serves 6.

## Ingredients

* Butter for pan
* 3 cup sliced plums
* 1/3 cup packed brown sugar
* 3/4 cup flour
* 1/3 c. granulated sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 3 eggs
* 1 1/4 cup milk
* 1 tablespoon brandy or other liqueur, if desired
* 1 teaspoon vanilla

## Directions

1.  Heat oven to 375 degrees. Place rack in middle position. Thoroughly butter a 10-inch baking dish or individual dishes.

1.  Arrange the plum slices in the baking dish, making sure some are skin side up, and sprinkle with brown sugar.

1.  In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar and salt.

1.  In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, brandy and vanilla. Add flour to milk mixture, whisking vigorously until no lumps remain. Pour the batter over the fruit and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until puffed and golden. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve immediately.
