I made this one afternoon, and the dish lasted two of us for several meals, and kept getting better and better. Definitely recommended with more bacon.

## Ingredients

* 12 to 16 oz. dried rigatoni
* 1 1/2 lb. butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into chunks (3 1/2 c.)
* 2 3/4 c. (1 percent) milk, divided
* 1/4 c. flour
* 8 oz. smoked Gouda cheese, shredded (2 c.), divided
* 4 slices thick bacon
* 2 small sweet onions, cut into chunks
* 3 slices firm 100 percent whole wheat or multigrain bread
* 2 tbsp. butter, melted
* Fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

* Lightly butter a 3-quart au gratin or baking dish; set aside. Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain; transfer to a large bowl.

* Meanwhile, in a large saucepan combine the squash and 2 1/2 cups milk over medium-high heat. Bring to boiling; reduce heat to medium, and simmer until the squash is tender when pierced with a fork, 18 to 20 minutes. Stir together remaining 1/4 cup milk and flour; stir into squash mixture. Bring to a boil and cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in 1 1/2 cups Gouda until melted; keep warm.

* Meanwhile, in a very large skillet cook bacon until crisp; drain on paper towels. Crumble and set aside. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon bacon drippings. Return skillet to the heat.

* Add onions to skillet; cover and cook over low heat 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Uncover and increase heat to high. Cook 4 to 6 minutes more, stirring, until onions are golden.

* Add squash-cheese mixture, onions and bacon to the bowl with the pasta. Toss well to combine, then transfer to prepared baking dish.

* Place bread in a food processor and pulse with 2 or 3 on/off turns to form large coarse crumbs (you should have about 2 cups). Transfer to a small bowl; mix with melted butter. Sprinkle remaining Gouda and the breadcrumbs over pasta mixture. Bake until top is browned, about 14 to 15 minutes. Cool 5 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley.


## Notes

This recipe uses a *lot* of pots and pans and the prep took a fair bit of time. Still, worth it, it makes a whack-load of casseroule.
