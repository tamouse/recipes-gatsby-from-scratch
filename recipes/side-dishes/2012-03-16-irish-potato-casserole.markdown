> Fabulous, but only 4 stars because I had to tweak A LOT! Follow
these instructions and you'll love it too. First cook at 400 not 350.
Increase shredded potatoes to SIX CUPS and reduce your butter to
1/3 cup. I didn't have paprika so I used 1 tsp of garlic spread mix
and a dash of pepper...yum! Cook for the 40 minutes then put it under
low broil for 5 minutes to crisp the top (watch it so you don't overdo
it). Pull it out, add your chedder and back in the oven just till
melted. Take it out and let it "rest" for 5 minutes before
eating. (This gives the butter a little time to absorb because you
will see some in there when you pull it out. My hubby and 3 girls
devoured this and was so sad I didn't make a bigger batch! I served it
with pork chops and veggies. Sooo good!


I would go ahead and follow the comments from the reviewer above. The
initial ingredients don't seem right, exactly. Definitely more
potatoes, less fat, less salt, more pepper. Consider also mixing in
some of the grated cheddar, not just sprinkling it on top.
