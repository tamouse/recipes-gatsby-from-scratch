One day, my dad brought home a bundle of bok choy, and didn't know what to do with it, so I found this and whipped it together with some other dish, and voila, a hit was born!


## Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
* 8 cups chopped fresh bok choy
* 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
* Salt and ground black pepper


## Directions

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger
and cook 1 minute. Add bok choy and soy sauce cook 3 to 5 minutes,
until greens are wilted and stalks are crisp-tender. Season, to taste,
with salt and black pepper.
