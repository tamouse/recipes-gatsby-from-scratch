This dish takes the sprout beyond the basic boiling or steaming and into new territory.

Most people simply boil the tar outten them sprouts, but learned
people know that steaming is better; this recipe, however, takes
sprouts out of the ordinary veggie accompaniment and into a whole new
territory.


## Ingredients

* 2-3 cups Brussels sprouts, cut in half with yellowed leaves removed
* 1 large shallot, sliced and separated
* 2 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* sea salt
* freshly ground black pepper


## Directions


1.  Heat oven to 350&degF;.

1.  Combine ingredients in an oven safe casserole and mix well.

1.  Cook 35-40 minutes, stirring 3-4 times, until Brussels sprouts are browned all around.

1.  Serve hot, with an extra sprinkling of sea salt.

Using sesame oil instead of olive oil (using a lot less!) gives these a real tasty turn.

This dish goes great alongside almost any chicken dish. Instead of using a
casserole dish, line a 9x13 inch baking pan with foil and spread the
sprout mixture over about 2/3rds of the pan and bake at 350 for 20
minutes or so (enough time to get the chicken ready), then arrange the
chicken in the other 1/3rd and lower the temp to 350 and bake an
additional 30 minutes.
