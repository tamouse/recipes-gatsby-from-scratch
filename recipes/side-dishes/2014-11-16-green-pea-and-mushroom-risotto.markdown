A simple, healthy dish. From Heal With Food.

## Ingredients

* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 2/4 lb crimini mushrooms, cleaned, stemmed, diced
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1 yellow onion, finely chopped
* 1 2/3 cups long grain brown rice, uncooked
* 4 1/4 cups vegetable broth (allergen-free)
* 3 tbsp parsley, chopped
* 1/4 lb frozen peas, thawed
* Salt and pepper
* Fresh parsley, for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saucepan. Add mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Cook, constantly stirring, for a few minutes until mushrooms soften. Transfer to a plate and set aside.

2. Using same saucepan, heat another 1 tablespoon olive oil, and add minced garlic and onion. Sauté for a few minutes until onions begin to turn translucent. Add rice and cook for a few minutes, constantly stirring.

3. Add half a cup of broth. Cook, stirring occasionally, until almost all broth is absorbed. Add another half a cup of broth each time liquid is absorbed until all broth is used and rice is almost cooked (use water if you run out of broth towards end).

4. Add peas, chopped parsley, and sautéed mushrooms. Cook for a few minutes, constantly stirring. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to serving plates and garnish with fresh parsley.
