The standard GBC is pretty basic: couple of cans of green beans, can
of mushroom soup, top with french fried onion strings. This retains
only some of that, but makes it into something more than a quick toss
together, with some substance.


## Ingredients
* 1.5 pounds green beans
* 4 slices bacon
* 1 can mushrooms, drained
* 1/4 cup walnuts
* 4 ounces swiss cheese
* 1 can cream of mushroom soup
* fresh ground pepper, to taste
* 1 small can french fried onion strings



## Directions

1.  heat oven to 350&degF;.

1.  wash, trim, and cut the green beans into 2 inch pieces.

1.  in a large pot, bring salted water to boil.

1.  parboil the green beans for 1 minute. drain and set aside.

1.  fry up the bacon, drain on paper towels, and crumble.

1.  chop the walnuts, not too fine.

1.  grate the swiss cheese.

1.  in a large bowl, combine beans, bacon, walnuts, drained mushrooms, swiss cheese, soup, ground pepper, and about half the can of onion strings.

1.  pour mixture into 1 1/2 quart casserole.

1.  bake at 350&degF; for about 25 minutes.
