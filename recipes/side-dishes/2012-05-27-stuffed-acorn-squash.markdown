A tasty, non-traditional way to bake acorn squash.

## Ingredients
* 2 acorn squash
* 1/2 cup chopped onion
* 1 cup diced celery
* 1/2 cup grated carrots
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
* 1 tablespoon dried parsley, or 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley
* 1 teaspoon dry rubbed sage
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed rosemary leaves
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
* 2 cups croutons (crumbled corn bread also does well in this recipe.)
* 1/2 cup water or broth


## Directions

1.  Heat up the oven to 350&degF;.

1.  Cut the squash in half, scooping out the seeds. Then scoop out and save more of the squash to make room for stuffing.

1.  Heat oil/butter/spray in a pan over medium heat. When hot, put in the onions, celery and carrots, and cook until the onion turns translucent, a few minutes.

1.  Add in the chopped nuts, herbs, and reserved squash pulp and cook for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally.

1.  Add in the dry croutons, stir thoroughly, then add the water or broth. The stuffing should be moist, but not very wet.

1.  Stuff each half of the squash and place in a baking pan.

1.  Cover the whole pan with foil and bake for 45 minutes, or until the squash is soft (larger squash will take longer).


This is great alone, but even better with a sauce over the top. A light cheese sauce or a meat gravy such as turkey gravy will go very well on top of this.
