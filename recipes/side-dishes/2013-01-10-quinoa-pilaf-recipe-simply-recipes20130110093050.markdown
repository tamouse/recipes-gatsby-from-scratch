South American high-protein quinoa, cooked with onions, garlic, bell peppers, pilaf style, with chopped fresh herbs added for the finish.


##  Ingredients

* Olive oil
* 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
* 1/2 bell pepper, finely chopped
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1/4 cup pine nuts
* 2 cups quinoa
* 4 cups water
* 1/8 teaspoon pepper
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil or Thai basil
* 2 Tbsp chopped fresh chives (or green onions including the greens)
* 1 cucumber, peeled, seeds removed, chopped
* Salt and pepper


##  Directions

1.  Place quinoa in a large sieve and rinse it until the water runs
clear. Heat 2 Tbsp of olive oil on medium high heat in a 3-4 quart
pot. Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic and pine nuts and cook,
stirring occasionally until the onions are translucent, but not
browned. Add the drained quinoa and cook, stirring occasionally for a
couple more minutes. You can let some of the quinoa get a little
toasted.

1.  Add 4 cups of water and one teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil and
reduce the heat to low so that the quinoa and water are simmering
while the pot is partially covered (enough to let out some
steam). Simmer for 20 minutes, or until the quinoa is tender and the
water has been absorbed. Remove from heat and put into a large serving
bowl. Fluff up with a fork.

1.  Let cool until just slightly warm, add 2-3 more tablespoons of
olive oil. Stir in chopped mint, basil, chives, and cucumber. Add salt
and pepper to taste.

Serve chilled or at room temperature.
