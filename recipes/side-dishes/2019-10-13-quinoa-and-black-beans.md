- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3/4 cup quinoa, uncooked
- 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup frozen corn kernels (1/2 a 15-ounce can if you use that, drained)
- 2 x 15-ounce cans black beans, rinsed and drained
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Directions

1. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
2. cook and stir onion and garlic until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
3. Mix quinoa into onion mixture and cover with vegetable broth, season with cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper.
4. Bring the mixture to a boil.
5. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until quinoa is tender and broth is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
6. Stir frozen corn into the saucepan, and continue to simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes
7. Mix in the black beans until heated through.
8. Add in the fresh cilantro (or omit as a garnish for those who don't like it)
