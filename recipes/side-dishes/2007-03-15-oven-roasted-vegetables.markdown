I love oven-roasted vegetables. They bring a distinctive flavour to salads and other dishes, as well as being great as an accompaniment to a main dish. 

This recipe came from somewhere, and as I read it over, it seems pretty rigid. Feel free to let loose with pretty much anything.

* 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper

* 2 medium zucchini 12 ounces  cut crosswise into 1 inch slices
* 2 medium yellow squash 12 ounces cut crosswise into 1 inch slices
* 1 large red onions 12 ounces cut into 8 wedges
* 1 large red bell pepper 6 ounces cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
* olive oil in a spray bottle

## Comments

There is something about balsamic vinegar that seems essential for roasted veggies.

One of the key herbs to use here is Rosemary. It is usually included in Italian Seasoning, but if you don't have that, a good mixture of Rosemary, Marjoram, Parsley, Sage, Thyme, Basil and/or Oregano is good.

This gets easier if you just put the oil, vinegar, spices and veggies in a big ziplock bag and shake it well before putting on the baking pan.

## Other things that you can roast:

* eggplant
* cherry tomatoes [roasted tomatoes]
* other colours of bell peppers (Yellow, Green, Orange, Purple)
* carrots
* [brussels sprouts]
* potatoes (all kinds, white, yellow, red, sweet, yams, etc)
* cauliflower (I don't think broccoli, cauliflower's sister, roasts as well)
* squash, all kinds
