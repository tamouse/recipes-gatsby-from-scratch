This is the classic family dressing recipe, with raisins.

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup butter
* 1 medium chopped onion
* 3-4 stalks chopped celery
* 2 cups chicken stock
* equal parts dried bread cubes and cornbread
* 1/4 cup raisins
* 2 teaspoons dried sage
* salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 325 F.

2. In large metal bowl with ring on the side, melt butter on stove top.

3. Saute onions and celery in butter.

4. Add chicken stock, bring to boil for 2 minutes.

5. Take off burner, add in the bread, raisins, and seasonings.

6. Put into oven-safe baking dish or loaf pan.

7. Bake at 325 F, covered, for 40 minutes. Uncover and continue baking for 20 more minutes.


## Notes

Can be baked in oven with turkey for final hour, if there is room!

Turkey typically cooks at 325 &deg; F, so oven temperature and baking time is set here to match that.
