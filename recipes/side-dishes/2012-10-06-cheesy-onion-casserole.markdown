Best Thanksgiving Side Dish Ever!

The original recipe calls for cream of chicken soup (or cream of
mushroom soup in a vague attempt to be vegetarian). Onion soup,
traditionally, is made with beef broth. Making with beef broth and a
white sauce would probably work.

## Ingredients

* 2-3 tablespoons butter or margarine
* 3 large sweet onions or 4 medium white or yellow onions
* 2 cup shredded Swiss cheese (8 oz.)
* 1 can cream of chicken soup, undiluted
* 2/3 cup milk
* 1 teaspoon soy sauce
* 8 or so slices of French bread


## Directions

1.  Slice onions

1.  Melt butter in a saute pan over medium heat, and add onions. Saute onions until clear, a little brown is ok.

1.  In a shallow 2 qt. casserole pan, layer onions, 2/3 of cheese and pepper to taste.

1.  In a sauce pan, heat soup, milk, and soy sauce, stirring to blend.

1.  Pour soup mixture in a casserole and stir gently to mix.

1.  Top with bread slices.

1.  Bake at 350&degF; uncovered for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, top of bread should be nice and toasted.

1.  Push bread slices under the sauce and top with the remaining cheese.

1.  Place casserole back in oven and finish baking for 15 more minutes.
