Wild rice is a nutty, dense version of rice, delicious addition to casseroles and soups.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup uncooked wild rice
* 3 cups water


## Directions

1.  Wash 1 cup uncooked wild rice thoroughly.

1.  In a pot, bring 3 cups lightly salted water to a boil.

1.  Add the 1 cup wild rice to the boiling water, returning water to a boil, and stir.

1.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, 50-60 minutes or until the kernels pop.

1.  Fluff with a fork, and simmer an additional 5 to 10 minutes uncovered.

1.  Drain any excess fluid.

For additional flavour, cook in chicken or beef broth. *Note:* avoid
bouillon as it is far too salty.

You can cook wild rice in the oven instead of the stove top; it can be
put directly into casseroles that will bake for a long time, provided
there is enough moisture in the casserole.

You can also cook wild rice in the microwave, although I've never
tried this. It still takes about half an hour in the microwave, so not
altogether clear there is that much convenience in it vs. the
stovetop.
