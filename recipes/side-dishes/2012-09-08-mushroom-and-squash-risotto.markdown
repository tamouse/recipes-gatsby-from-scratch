A very tasty sounding Italian dish fit for a dinner party.



## Ingredients
* &frac12; ounce dried porcini mushrooms
* &frac12; pound shiitake mushrooms
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 cinnamon stick, broken in half
* 3 black peppercorns
* kosher salt
* 1 pound mixed mushroom (such as oyster and cremini)
* 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
* &frac14; teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 8 ounces butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and diced
* 2 cups arborio rice
* 1 cup dry white wine
* &frac12; cup grated aged gouda or parmesan cheese, plus shaved cheese for garnish
* &frac12; cup chopped fresh parsley


## Directions

1.  Soak porcinis in 5 cups hot water for 30 minutes. Strain into saucepan, squeezing the liquid from the procinis. Chop the porcinis and set aside.

1.  Make the mushroom broth: Remove the shiitake stems and transfer to a separate saucepan. Add 5 cups water, the bay leaf, &frac12; cinnamon stick, peppercorns and %frac12; teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, cook 3 minutes, then remove from heat and set aside to infuse, 30 minutes. Strain into the saucepan with the porcini soaking liquid, squeezing the liquid from the shiitake stems; discard the solids.

1.  Meanwhile, chop the shiitake mushroom caps and mixed mushrooms. Heat 3 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in an extra-large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, red pepper flakes and the remaining &frac12; cinnamon stick and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the shiitake caps and the mixed mushrooms in an even layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir and continue cooking until the mushrooms are soft, about 3 more minutes. Season with salt and discard the cinnamon stick.

1.  Bring the mushroom broth to a simmer. Heat 2 tablespoons butter and the 1 remaining tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the squash, onion, porcinis, and &frac12; teaspoon salt; cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the rice and toast, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Add the wine and simmer, stirring, until absorbed, about 1 minute. Add 3 cups hot broth, return to simmer and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid is absorbed, 8 to 10 more minutes. Add 3 more cups broth and mushroom mixture; bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, until rice is *al dente*, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, the grated cheese and parsley.

1.  Add more broth if needed, season with salt and garnish with the shaved cheese to serve.
