These creamy Middle Eastern-style potatoes are flavored with turmeric
and use olive oil rather than butter. They are great alone, and for
fillings in puff pastries. Amounts of salt, pepper, and other spices
may be adjusted to taste.


## Ingredients

* 1-1/4 large baking potatoes, peeled and cubed
* 1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
* 1/8 onion, diced
* 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cumin

## Directions

1.  Place the potatoes into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook until tender and can be pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes.

1.  Meanwhile, place 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet, and heat over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion and cook until translucent and lightly browned, about 6 minutes.

1.  Drain water from the potatoes, and mash. Stir in the onion, and continue mashing. Mix in the turmeric, salt, pepper, and cumin. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, or amount desired to make the potatoes more or less creamy.

I think I would substitute butter for the olive oil for this crowd -- I personally would much prefer the olive oil, but others would object.
