I'm not sure where this recipe came from, but it's a real winner using left over turkey (or even browned ground turkey). I do it without the jalapenos, because I don't like their taste. Using a habanero would be awesome.

## Ingredients

* 2 cups leftover turkey, chopped
* 1 cup onion, coarsely chopped
* 1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch cubes
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced, if desired
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 1.5 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1.5 teaspoons ground coriander
* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
* 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, if desired
* 2 (14.5 ounce) cans of low sodium whole tomatoes, coarsely chopped
* 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
* 1 (14.5 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
* 1/4 cup cheddar cheese, shredded


## Directions

1.  in a large stock pot, combine turkey, onion, peppers, garlic and spices. Simmer for 3 minutes.

1.  add tomatoes, tomato sauce; bring to a boil, reduce to simmer uncovered for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

1.  add beans and cilantro, simmer 10 more minutes.

1.  serve in bowls and top with cheese.
