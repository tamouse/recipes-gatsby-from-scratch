A pretty simple, classic slow-cooker version, modified to be gluten-free and dairy-free, and to fit my needs for preparation.


## Ingredients

- 14oz package frozen butternut squash cubes, thawed
- 2 carrots, peeled and cut into chunks
- 1 medium yellow onion, quartered
- 1 potato, peeled and cut into chunks
- 1 pint chicken stock
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 500&deg;F
2. Line a baking pan with foil
3. Spread squash, carrots, and onion out into a single layer on the prepared baking pan
4. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly browned, about 10 minutes
5. Pour roasted squash pieces, carrots, onions, and potato into slow cooker
6. Pour chicken stock over vegetables and stir in bay leaf, garlic powder, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper
7. Cook on High for 4 hours, stirring once
8. DISCARD BAY LEAF before pur&eacute;ing
8. Pur&eacute;e soup with an immersion blender until smooth

## Notes

I was not so precise on the amount of squash I used. I had a 10oz package so that's what I used. I thawed in the microwave before adding it to the other vegetables.

I added oil and salt to the vegetables mix before putting it on the pan to roast.

10 minutes was not enough time to lightly brown the vegetables.
