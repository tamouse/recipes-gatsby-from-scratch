This is just plain, old, chicken soup from scratch

## Ingredients

* 2 chicken breasts, cubed
* 2 carrots, quartered
* 2 celery stalks, halved
* 1 onion, quartered
* 1 package Knorr chicken soup start
* salt and pepper to taste
* bay leaf
* water to cover

## Directions

1. Put all ingredients into a pot with water to cover by about an inch
2. Bring water to boil, cover, and set to simmer for maybe an hour
3. Using a large collandar, strain the broth into a large pot
4. Chop the vegetables and return to the pot
5. Salt and pepper to taste
6. Warm the soup ingredients through and serve

## Notes

This &uarr; is what I did the last time I made this.

### Additions/Mods

- miso and/or soy/tahini to make a base for ramen (miso is not GF)
- noodles, rice, potatoes, etc., to give the soup some body, but it's
  pretty good on its own, too (use GF pasta)
- could use skin-on thighs for more flavor, but you have to skim the
  fat, too
- white wine
- tinned broth
- bouillon
