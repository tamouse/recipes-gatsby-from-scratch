Tomato soup is a family favourite


## Ingredients
* 3 tablespoon good-quality olive oil
* 1&frac12; cup chopped red onions (2 onions)
* 2 carrots, unpeeled and chopped
* 1 tablespoon minced garlic (3 cloves)
* 4 pound vine-ripened tomatoes, coarsely chopped (5 large)
* 1&frac12; tsp. sugar
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* &frac14; cup packed chopped fresh basil leaves, plus julienned basil leaves, for garnish
* 3 cup chicken stock
* 1 tablespoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* &frac12; cup heavy cream
* Croutons, for garnish


## Directions

1.  Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-low heat. Add the onions and carrots, and saut√© about 10 minutes, until very tender. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, sugar, tomato paste, basil, chicken stock, salt and pepper, and stir well. Bring the soup to a boil, lower the heat and simmer uncovered for 30 to 40 minutes, until the tomatoes are very tender.

1.  Add the cream to the soup. Process soup through a food mill (discarding only the dry pulp that remains) or run soup carefully through a blender. Reheat the soup over low heat just until hot and serve with garnish of basil leaves and/or croutons.
