This is a classic from my mom's collection of recipes. I'm not sure
where it came from originally, but it sure is a winner!


## Ingredients

* 2/3 cup uncooked, or 2 cups cooked, wild rice
* 1/4 cup butter
* 1 onion
* 2 stalks celery
* 1/2 pound fresh, or 1 large can of mushrooms

* 1/2 teaspoon curry powder
* 1/2 teaspoon ground sage
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (to taste)

1.  Cook the wild rice according to the package directions. (Approx. 40 minutes.)

1.  Dice an onion, fine.

1.  Dice the celery, fine.

1.  Chop up mushrooms, not too fine.
