I'm not sure where this recipe came from, but it's a grand soup, a beet-based borscht.

## Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 pounds beef stew meat, cut in 3/4-inch cubes
* 4 bay leaves
* 2 quarts beef stock (preferrably low-/no-sodium)
* 2 large onions, chopped
* 2 carrots, peeled and chopped
* 2 stalks celery, cleaned and chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 8 medium-sized beets, skinned, boiled, shredded
* 2 cups shredded cabbage
* 1 small can tomato paste
* Juice of 2 or 3 lemons
* 1 handfull fresh dill, minced
* 1 handfull fresh parsley, minced
* salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
* sour cream for garnish (optional)


## Directions
1.  in a large pot, heat the oil on high for 30 seconds. Add the beef cubes and bay leaves. Saut&eacute; until golden brown. Pour in the stock and reduce heat.

1.  Add the onions, carrots, celery, and garlic. Simmer on low for 2 hours, or until the meat is meltingly tender, making sure soup never boils. Add the beets and cabbage during the last half hour of cooking.

1.  Spoon in the tomato paste and sprinkle with the lemon juice. Add a little hot water if the soup is too thick. Stir in dill and parsley, Season with salt and pepper.

1.  Serve in bowls, garnishing with sour cream if desired.
