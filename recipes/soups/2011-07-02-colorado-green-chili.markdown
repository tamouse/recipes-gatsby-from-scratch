Like it's cousin, [Colorado Red Chili], this recipe came from a friend
of mine out in Colorado who goes by the handle Fielding Melish.  This
is a green variety of chili, a chili verde. Note that the "Colorado"
in the title doesn't mean the Spanish word for "red" -- it's where the
recipe originated.

## Ingredients

* 2 lb pork roast
* 4-6 tomatillos (little green tomatoes)
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1 cup of water (or use beer)
* 1 chopped habañero (cf WorkingWithPeppers)
* Cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1.  Put onion in bottom of crockpot

1.  Wash roast and place in crockpot

1.  Chop and seed the tomatillos and add to crockpot

1.  Add water (or beer) to crockpot

1.  Cook on low for 7-8 hours

1.  Remove roast from cooker and shred, returning meat to crockpot

1.  Add habañero and spices, cook an additional 1-2 hours

Serve in bowls with shredded cheese, or in warm tortillas with shredded cheese and lettuce, and salsa, sour cream and/or guac as toppers.

## Variations

Some people like to add beans to chili. This mostly works as is, but you can always add:

* kidney beans
* pinto beans
* black beans (Probably the best)
