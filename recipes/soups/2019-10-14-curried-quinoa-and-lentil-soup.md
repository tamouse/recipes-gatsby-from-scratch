This recipe purported to be both dairy free and vegan, yet it listed "unsalted butter"; I replaced it with vegan butter (e.g. Earth Balance Red). It sounds like a really great curry.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- 1 cup vegetable broth
- 1/3 cup red lentils
- 1/4 cup finely chopped onion
- 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
- 1 cup rainbow quinoa
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 3 cups chopped kale
- 1/2 cup frozen peas
- 1 tablespoon vegan butter, or more to taste (optional)

## Directions

1. Bring water and broth to a boil in a stockpot.
2. Add lentils, onion, jalapeno pepper, and garlic and cover stockpot, reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 10 minutes.
3. Mix quinoa, cumin, curry powder, salt, chili powder, cinnamon, black pepper, coriander, cardamom, and cloves into broth mixture and return to a boil.
4. Cover stockpot, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until quinoa is tender, about 10 minutes more.
5. Stir the kale, peas, and vegan butter into the quinoa mixture and return to a boil.
6. Cover stockpot, reduce heat to medium, and cook until kale and peas are tender, about 10 minutes more.
