A nice fall/winter soup that can serve as a vegetarian meal

The [spiced pecans] make this a most interesting soup. Makes 6 1-1/3 cup servings.


## Ingredients

* 5 to 6 medium carrots, peeled, coarsely chopped
* 1 large white onion, peeled, quartered
* 2 to 3 cloves garlic
* 1 (3- to 4-pound) pumpkin or butternut squash, seeded and quartered
* olive oil
* salt
* freshly cracked black pepper
* 8 fresh sage leaves
* 4 tablespoons packed brown sugar, divided
* 6 cups vegetable broth
* SpicedPecans
* a few sprigs of Italian flat-leaf parsley or cilantro

## Directions

1.  Heat oven to 375&degF;.

1.  Line roasting pan with foil.

1.  Place carrots, onion and garlic in pan.

1.  Drizzle with olive oil and toss until coated.[^Actually, this is a lot easier if you put the vegetables and oil in a zip-lock bag and shake.^]

1.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

1.  Add pumpkin quarters to pan.

1.  Spread one tablespoon of brown sugar on each pumpkin quarter. [^I think the brown sugar can safely be omitted.^]

1.  Top with sage leaves.

1.  Drizzle with olive oil.

1.  Roast vegetables 45 to 60 minutes, or until pumpkin flesh is soft.

1.  Meanwhile, in a 4-quart Dutch Oven bring broth just to boiling and remove from heat.

1.  Set aside to cool slightly.

1.  Remove vegetables from oven.

1.  Discard sage leaves.

1.  Scoop pumpkin flesh into a medium bowl (there should be about 5 cups).

1.  In batches, add vegetables and pumpkin to blender or food processor; blend or process until smooth, adding enough cooled broth to reach desired level of consistency.

1.  To serve, divide soup evenly among six cups or bowls.

1.  Top with spiced pecans and cilantro.
