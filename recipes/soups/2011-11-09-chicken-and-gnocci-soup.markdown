A delicious soup that is filling and wonderful.

This soup is a great use of leftover chicken, but in my case I just
cooked chicken tenders that I seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic
powder in the oven at 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes, until done. Also,
you can find the gnocchi in the pasta section of your grocery store.

## Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 small onion, diced
* 3 stalks celery, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 carrots, shredded
* 1 pound cooked, cubed chicken breast
* 4 cups chicken broth
* 1 (16 ounce) package mini potato gnocchi
* 1 (6 ounce) bag baby spinach leaves
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional)
* 2 tablespoons cold water (optional)
* 2 cups half-and-half cream
* salt and ground black pepper to taste





## Directions
1.  Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook onion, celery,
  garlic, and carrots in the hot oil until onion is translucent, about 5
  minutes. Stir in cubed chicken and chicken broth; bring to a simmer. 

1.  Stir gnocchi into the simmering soup and cook until they begin to
  float, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in spinach; cook until wilted, about 3
  additional minutes.
  
1.  Whisk cornstarch into cold water until smooth. Stir cornstarch
  mixture and half-and-half into simmering soup. Cook until soup
  thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and
  black pepper.
