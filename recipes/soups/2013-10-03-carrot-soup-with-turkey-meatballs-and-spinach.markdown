A really tasty and hearty soup; perfect for the cold months!

## Ingredients

### For soup:

-   2 Tbsp olive oil
-   2 lb carrots, chopped
-   1 large onion, chopped
-   4 cloves garlic, smashed
-   Kosher salt
-   1 pinch red pepper flakes
-   4 cups chicken, turkey, or vegetable broth (homemade or
    reduced-sodium canned)
-   2 cups baby spinach leaves, sliced

### For meatballs:

-   1/2 lb ground turkey
-   1/4 cup grated Â­Parmesan or pecorino cheese
-   1/2 cup bread crumbs
-   2 Tbsp milk (or water)
-   1 clove garlic, minced
-   Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper

## Directions

1.  Make soup: Warm oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add carrots,
    onion, garlic, 1/2 tsp salt, and red pepper flakes and saut&eacute;,
    stirring, until vegetables begin to brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in
    broth, scraping up any bits stuck to bottom of pot. Cover pot and
    simmer until carrots are tender, stirring occasionally, about 30
    minutes.

2.  Meanwhile, make meatballs: Mix all ingredients in a medium bowl,
    season with salt and pepper, and roll into 1-inch balls, spreading
    them out on a platter.

3.  Puree soup in a blender, or with an
    immersion blender, until smooth. If using blender, return soup to
    pot. Bring to a simmer. Add meatballs and let simmer until meatballs
    are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Add spinach and simmer until
    wilted, about 1 minute. Season servings with salt and pepper to
    taste.
