## Ingredients

* 6 medium leeks, about 3 lb.
* 4 tbsp. butter
* Salt and pepper
* 4 garlic cloves, minced
* Pinch of cayenne
* 1/2 c. rice
* 8 c. hot chicken broth or water
* 10 oz. baby spinach, washed
* Grated nutmeg, to taste
* 1/2 c. crème fraîche (see Note)
* 2 tbsp. thinly sliced chives, for garnish
* 2 tbsp. thinly sliced tarragon, for garnish

## Directions

1. Trim leeks of outer layer and stems. Chop white and tender green
   parts into 1/2-inch chunks (discard tough gray-green parts). Soak
   leeks in a large bowl of lukewarm water, swishing to dislodge
   sand. Drain and soak again, then lift leeks, leaving sediment
   behind.

2. Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed soup pot over medium heat. Add
   leeks and season well with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until
   leeks are wilted, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, cayenne and
   rice and cook for 1 minute. Add hot broth and bring to a boil, then
   reduce to a gentle simmer. Simmer until rice is very soft, about 25
   minutes. Remove from heat and let cool completely before
   proceeding.

3. Using a blender, purée raw spinach with cooled soup mixture. Strain
   through a fine-meshed sieve, discarding any fibrous solids. Adjust
   seasoning and add grated nutmeg. Thin with broth or water if
   necessary. Heat soup before serving, to preserve bright green
   color. Garnish with a tablespoon of crème fraîche and a sprinkling
   of chives and tarragon.

## Notes

Crème fraîche is a thickened cream, similar to sour cream, which could
be substituted.
