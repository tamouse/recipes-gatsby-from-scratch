I made this on Nov 11, 2013, and everyone enjoyed it a lot.
A very nicely spiced pumpkin soup, with curry and cumin. This could
make an awesome base for a curry, perhaps with the addition of a can
of stewed tomatoes.

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon oil or butter, to fry onions
* 1 onion, chopped fine
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* 1 teaspoon curry powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon cardamom
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 2 cups reduced sodium chicken broth
* 1 (15 ounce) can of pumpkin
* 1 (12 ounce) can of *evaporated* milk

### For garnish, optional

* plain greek-style yogurt
* chopped parsley

## Directions

1. In a large stock- or soup-pot, heat oil or butter. Add onion and
cook until translucent, about 3 minutes or so.

2. Add the garlic and continue cooking for another minute.

3. Add the dry spices, stirring and mixing in well. Dry cook for about
1 minute, stirring.

4. Whisk in the broth slowly, and scrape up the bottom bits of the
spice and onion mixture into the broth.

5. Whisk in the pumpkin until all is integrated.

6. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce to simmer for 15 minutes,
stirring occasionally.

7. Add the *evaporated* milk, stir in well, and cook for 2 or 3 more
minutes.

8. Using an immersion blender, pur&eacute;e soup until smooth.

Ladle into bowls, add yogurt and parsley garnish if desired (It really
doesn't need any).

Add pepper to taste.
