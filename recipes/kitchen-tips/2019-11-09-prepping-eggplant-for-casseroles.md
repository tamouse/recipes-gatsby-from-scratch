Eggplant, especially the large European variety, contain a lot of moisture; unless you're frying the eggplant slices before using them, they need some prep work to be good in casseroles and bakes.

## Ingredients ##

- 2 pounds eggplant (1 large or 2 small)
- kosher or coarse (sea) salt

## Directions ##

1. Heat the oven to 450&deg;F
2. Spray a baking sheet with oil
3. Trim the ends off the eggplant
4. Slice into 1/4 inch slices
5. Arrange slices on the prepared baking sheet
6. Season with the salt
7. Bake 10 minutes
8. Flip pieces over
9. Bake another 10 minutes

The eggplant should be golden brown.
