A better way to cook vegetables.

If you're like my parents, you grew up with vegetables that were
mostly boiled. And mostly had the tar boiled completely out of
them. *Yuck!* Herewith is a way to get nicely steamed vegetable using
a microwave, and not resorting to tossing everything in a pot of water
and leaving it sit on the stove.

## Microwave?

Yes, microwave. This is one of the things this appliance does
extremely well is steam veggies. Rather than aquiring mesh baskets and
figuring out how to suspend them in a pot of water, and trying to
figure out how to extract them when done, simply putting the veggies
on a pie plate, adding a bit of water, covering with clear wrap and
nuking for 5 minutes or so is all you need to get perfectly steamed
veggies.

I've used this method with just about every vegetable imaginable, and
I swear it is the way to go. This is what microwaves were built for.

Most things like brocolli, cauliflower, beans, carrots, fresh peas,
fresh kernel corn (not corn on the cob, see below), sugar snap peas,
snow peas, and the like take only about 5 minutes on high to get
nicely steamed. Of course this can depend on the quantity you are
cooking, and the power of your microwave. The best thing to do here is
to experiment a bit to see how fast your microwave will cook
veggies. Start off with like 6 ounces of cut up veggies and a bit of
water in the bottom of the dish, cover, and cook for 5 minutes to see
how done the veggies have gotten. If they aren't yet done to your
liking, add a couple more minutes time (or one minute at a time if you
prefer more control).

Some vegetables take longer to steam. Rutabega, turnips, parsnips,
potatoes and other root vegetables take about 8-10 minutes to cook,
depending on quantity and power again. (For instance, in my parent's
microwave, 2 large potatoes, split, covered, takes about 12 minutes to
get cooked properly.) Corn on the cob also takes longer to cook in the
microwave. Usually, for corn on the cob, you wash and wrap each ear
separately in clear wrap (saran or cling wrap) and microwave on one
side for 8 minutes, turn over and microwave the other side for 6
minutes.

Note this method also works great with frozen vegetables and
fruits. You may not even have to add any water.
