When you need crumbled bacon or bacon bits, here is a good way I've
found to handle them.

If you need a 1/4 pound of bacon bits, instead of pealing off 4
slices, just cut a 1/4 of a pound of bacon off an end.

Chop up the chunk of bacon you've just hacked off into smaller pieces,
about bite sized should do. Note: partially frozen bacon is much
easier to cut than fully thawed bacon.

Cook these pieces over medium-high heat, keeping an eye on them,
stirring them so they don't stick and burn, and pulling the pieces
apart.

When done, to crisp but not burnt stage, pull the pieces out with a
straining spoon and place on paper towels to absorb the grease. You
can further crumble the bacon from this stage if desired.
