Normally, zucchini would be far too wet to make a good lasagne, so this technique can be used to make the zucchini more suitable as a stand-in for the pasta noodles.

## Ingredients

* 3 large zucchini (about 2 pounds total)
* kosher or a coarse salt

## Directions

1. Trim the ends off the zucchini
2. Cut the zucchini in half crosswise
3. Thinly slice each piece lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick planks
4. Set a colander over a sink
4. Place the zucchini slices in a colander and gently toss with the salt
5. Drain for 15 minutes
6. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 450Â°F
7. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper
8. Divide the zucchini planks between the baking sheets in a single layer
9. Pat them dry with a paper towel
10. Roast until the zucchini is dry to the touch, 10 to 15 minutes
