This is a recreation of a recipe I had made up in my old recipe book. This is basically what I remember, but it could probably use some tweaking.

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds tortellini pasta, cooked al dente and cooled.
* 1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled.
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
* 1/8 teaspoon dry mustard
* 1 cup snow peas, cut into bite-sized pieces and blanched.
* 2-3 scallions or green onions, diced
* salt & pepper to taste
* a few sprigs of fresh parsley, chopped (1/2 a bunch?)

## Directions

1.  Cook the pasta until it is al dente. Tortellini floats when it is done. Drain and cool in cold water.

1.  Cut up the snow peas into bite-sized pieces and blanche in boiling water for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Drain and cool in cold water.

1.  Whisk the oil, vinegar and mustard.

1.  Combine the cooled tortellini, snow peas, chopped green onions and crumbled feta cheese, salt & pepper, chopped parsley, and toss with the dressing.

1.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.


## Variations

Today, 30 July 2011, I didn't have all the above ingredients, yet I wanted to get the tortellini used before it went bad. I made the following substitutions:
* For feta, I used gorgonzolla, and added a bit of parmesan
* Instead of dry mustard, I used a bit of yellow mustard
* Instead of snow peas, I used regular frozen peas
* I added a dash of ground thyme and oregano
* I used about 2 tablespoons of dry parsley instead of fresh.

I whisked all the spices and herbs together with the oil, vinegar and mustard and let it sit for a bit while the pasta and peas were cooking.

It was a winner!
