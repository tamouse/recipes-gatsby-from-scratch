A nice summery salad with pasta, peas and chicken.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 c dry pasta rings
* 2 whole chicken breasts (boneless, skinless)
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 tsp minced garlic
* 2 tsp tamara soy sauce
* 1/2 tsp salt (possibly omit)
* 3/8 pound pea pods, or 1 cup frozen peas
* 1/2 cup sliced green onions (using only white, saving 2 tsp green for garnish) *i think adding some green parts to the salad would be just fine!*
* 1/2 cup Miracle Whip
* 3 tsp tamari soy sauce
* 1/2 tsp salt (possibly omit)
* 1/4 tsp white pepper

## Directions

1.  Cook pasta rings until just tender. Drain and cool.

1.  Cut chicken into bite sized pieces. Heat wok/pan, add oil and garlic. Add chicken and stir fry for 2 minutes. Add soy sauce and stir fry 2 minutes longer until chicken turns white. Remove from wok/pan, draining oil, and cool in refridgerator. *Much less oil can be used I think.*

1.  Remove strings from pea pods and break into bite sized pieces. Bring 1 qt of water to rolling boil and blanch pea pods for 30 seconds. *If using frozen peas, just boil them for 1 minute to unthaw them.* Drain and rinse under cold running water to cool quickly.

1.  In a bowl, combine the cooled rings, chicken, peas, and onions with the Miracle Whip, soy sauce, salt (maybe) and pepper.

1.  For garnish, use 2 tbsp sliced green onion tops. Refridgerate overnight or at least 4 hours.

Makes 4 servings, 1 cup each.
