There's very little about this recipe that is Chinese. The ramen is
japanese, for example. It calls for red wine vinegar instead of rice
vinegar as well. Broccoli slaw instead of shredded chinese cabbage.

I had another recipe for Chinese Chicken Salad that I hope to recreate
someday, but this looks pretty serviceable for now, if I add some
cooked chicken to it.

## Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
* 2 tablespoons white sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1 (3 ounce) package chicken flavored ramen noodles, crushed, seasoning packet reserved
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 (16 ounce) package broccoli coleslaw mix
* 1/2 cup chopped green onions
* 4 ounces toasted slivered almonds
* 1/4 cup sesame seeds, toasted


## Directions

1.  In a small saucepan, cook the vinegar and sugar over medium heat until dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in salt, pepper, ramen seasoning packet and oil. Set aside to cool.

1.  In a large bowl, combine the uncooked ramen noodles, broccoli coleslaw mix, and green onions. Pour dressing over salad; toss evenly to coat. Refrigerate until chilled.

1.  Sprinkle with almonds and sesame seeds before serving.

I have not tried this recipe to be sure, but the vinegar:oil ratios
seem really off to me. I'd also use rice wine vinegar instead of red
wine+sugar for more authenticity. Also, instead of broccoli slaw
(although it sounds good) for more authenticity I'd use shredded
Chinese cabbage.
