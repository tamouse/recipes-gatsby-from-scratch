A great summertime salad that is always a hit at potlucks

This has been a favourite in my family since I was kid. It's quite
similar to [Broccoli Salad] -- I think one came from the other, but
I'm not sure which order that happened in.


## Ingredients
* 1 large head cauliflower
* 1 spanish (sweet) onion (or a red onion)
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/3 cup parmesan cheese
* 2 cups miracle whip
* 1 large head of lettuce
* 1 pound of bacon
* 1/2 box good seasoned croutons


## Directions

This salad is made in two parts. The first part is made ahead of time, and the second part is made and put together just before serving.

### Part 1 - do ahead

1.  break up cauliflower into small bite-sized chunks

1.  slice onion very thinly and separate layers

1.  in a bowl, mix sugar, parmesan cheese and miracle whip together

1.  combine cauliflower, onion and dressing and stir to coat completely

1.  refrigerate for at least 4 hours, overnight is better

### Part 2 - do while part 1 is chilling

1.  slice up bacon and fry in a pan

1.  remove bacon pieces with a slotted spoon and set on paper towels to drain and dry

1.  break up head of lettuce into small, bite-sized pieces

### Part 3 - just before serving
1.  combine salad from Part 1 with Part 2

1.  serve
