Using sweet and white potatoes, this salad is a bit of a surprise, but
very enjoyable.

* 1 sweet potato
* 4 eggs
* 2 stalks celery, chopped
* 1/2 onion, chopped
* 3/4 cup mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon prepared mustard
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook
   until tender but still firm, about 30 minutes. Drain, cool, peel
   and chop.

   a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water
   for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water; cool, peel and chop.
