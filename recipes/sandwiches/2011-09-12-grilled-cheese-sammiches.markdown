Grilled cheese sammiches are the traditional midwestern comfort
food. Paired with tomato soup, they are wonderful for when things are
cold and blowy, or when you don't want to think about what to make.


## Ingredients

* 2 slices of any kind of bread
* butter, for outsides of bread
* cheese. Lots, various kinds, whatever. It works best in slices.

## Directions

1. warm up a pan or griddle.

1. butter the outsides of both slices of bread.

1. when the griddle/pan is hot, lay one slice of bread, butter-side down, on the griddle.

1. layer on the slices of cheese you want. Use a fairly good amount. Mixing varieties of cheese is also pretty wonderful.

1. place the top slice of bread, butter-side up, on top.

1. let grill for about 5 minutes on the side. Flip entire sandwich over and grill other side for about 5 minutes. 

The heat of the griddle/pan will depend on how long you grill for --
don't set the heat too high as it is much more likely to end up with
charred bread and solid insides. Lower heat is more easily managed.

If you have a sandwich/panini grill, or one of those George Foreman
Grills, they can make doing grilled cheese really easy, grilling both
sided of the sandwich at the same time, and smooshing it a bit to give
some extra tooth.

## Additions:

### So many things can be added to the basic grilled cheese, here are but a few:

* sliced tomatoes
* bacon strips
* mashed avocado or guacamole
* cold cuts
* liverwurst
* pickles

### Spread on *inside* of bread:

* pesto
* flavoured mayo spreads
* mustard
* peanut butter (?! -- yeah, I didn't think so, either, but it works!)
