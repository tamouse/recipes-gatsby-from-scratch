In a small skillet, fry a small
amount of the meat mixture in a little butter.

Taste for seasoning and

Blanch bacon by simmering in hot water about 3
minutes. If pork belly is used, blanching is not necessary.

slices, covering sides and bottom; pack gyros meat into pan, filling
to the top of the pan.

Cover with remaining slices of bacon or
pork.

Place filled pan in hot water bath, reaching 3/3/4 of the way up
the loaf pan.

Bake at 375&degF; for 20-30 minutes.

Reduce heat to 325&degF;
and continue baking 30 minutes longer.

Remove pan from oven; remove
loaf pan from hot water bath and place on wire rack to cool.

Cover

loaf.

Cool to room temperature; refrigerate meat, covered with weight
12 hours or overnight to ripen and increase flavor.

Meat will keep for
up to 4 days refrigerated.

Slice thin and serve in pita bread with
sliced onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce.
