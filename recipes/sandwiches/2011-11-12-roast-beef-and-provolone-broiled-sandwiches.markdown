This recipe originally was clipped out of an ad, but I've since done
away with that recipe in favour of my own.

Try with a dollop of stone ground mustard on the bun before putting on the meat.


Serves 3.


## Ingredients
* 1/2 pound lean sliced roast beef from the deli
* 3 slices provolone cheese
* 1 can french onion soup, concentrated
* 1 small can of sliced mushrooms
* 3 onion rolls, split and toasted


## Directions

1.  Heat broiler to 400&degF;.

1.  Place onion soup and mushrooms into a pot and warm on the stove.

1.  When warm, stir in slices of roast beef to warm through and soak up the soup.

1.  Toast the split onion rolls.

1.  On a baking sheet, arrange bottom and top halves of buns separately.

1.  Stack roast beef on bottoms of rolls.

1.  Cover with the mushrooms.

1.  Ladle some of the soup over the pile of mushrooms and beef.

1.  Top each with a slice of provolone cheese.

1.  Place in the oven and broil for about 10 minutes or so.

1.  Serve immediately with the rest of the soup mixture for dipping and ladling on the sandwiches.
