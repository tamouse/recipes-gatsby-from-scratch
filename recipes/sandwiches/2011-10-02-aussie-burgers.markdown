The times I've visited Australia have been magical, in no small part
because of the way they make some food their own. The hamburger, a
traditional American fry-out food, is transformed into something
glorious here. What really makes it aussie is "put an egg onnit".


## Ingredients

* 4 kaiser rolls, split
* 1 pound of ground beef
* 1 medium onion, sliced into discs
* 1 or 2 cloves garlic, minced
* slices of cheese to top: Cheddar, Swiss, Provolone, Muenster, etc
* 4 slices canadian bacon (or back bacon)
* 4 eggs
* 4 pineapple rings
* 1 large tomato, sliced
* 4 lettuce leaves

### various condiments: (*very* optional)

* ketchup, aka "red sauce"
* mustard
* mayo
* dill relish

1.  make 4 patties out of the ground beef and cook them on a grill, or fry in a pan

1.  in a medium hot skillet, add some butter and fry up the onions and garlic. fry until translucent, or continue until carmelized. remove onions, set aside. 

1.  crack the eggs into the still hot skillet and fry up (in some places, they break the yoke, in others, they don't, your choice, mate). Cook eggs until yolks are solid, turning once. remove and set aside.
