This is the classic roast turkey recipe I've been following for some time, when I don't make the apricot glazed turkey. This is pretty universal.

## Cooking Times

These may vary with oven, and possibly with size of bird.

**Unstuffed:** (which is usually the way to go): 15-18 minutes per pound.

**Stuffed:** 20-25 minutes per pound.

**Best bet:** Read the directions on the turkey wrap if you bought one that way.

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 400 &deg; F.

2. Remove all wrapping from bird.

3. Remove giblets, neck, and gravy pack, and any other sorts of things you might find inside. If there's a clip for the legs, leave it in place.

4. Salt and pepper the inside of the bird.

5. Put turkey in roasting pan, breast side **up**.

6. Cut a slit in the sides to tuck the wing tips in.

6. Lifting the skin, spread butter underneath somewhat liberally.

7. Salt and season the bird on the outside.

8. Place turkey in pan into hot oven and roast at 400 &deg; F for 30 minutes.

9. Turn down the oven to 325 &deg; F and continue to cook the turkey for the alloted time, basting the juices back over the turkey every half an hour or so.

10. To see if the bird is done, insert a meat thermometer into the thigh. The internal temperature should be 185 &deg; F. Or, wiggle the leg, it should be loose and any juices should run *clear*.
