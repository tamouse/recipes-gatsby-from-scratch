Ground turkey, italian herbs, garlic, and marinara.

Modified to be dairy-free.


## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground turkey
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 yellow onion (finely diced)
- 2 zucchini’s (finely chopped)
- 2 garlic cloves (finely chopped)
- 1 cup low carb marinara sauce
- 1 cup riced cauliflower
- 1 teaspoons Italian seasoning blend
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 and 1/4  teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 400° F
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat
3. Add ground turkey and crumble into small pieces
4. Add half the salt, pepper, 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning and garlic powder
5. Cook for 3-5 minutes until browned
6. Stir in onions, garlic, zucchini, riced cauliflower, marinara sauce, and remaining seasonings into the turkey mixture
7. Mix well and cook for for 8-10 minutes until veggies have softened
8. Remove from heat and add to an 9×9 casserole dish
10. Place in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes until cheese is melted.
11. Remove the baking dish from the oven and serve.

(The original recipe called for putting balls of mozzarella cheese on the casserole before baking. I'm not sure there'd be a good dairy-free version of that. Serving it with cashew parmesean ("nooch") seems ideal, though.)
