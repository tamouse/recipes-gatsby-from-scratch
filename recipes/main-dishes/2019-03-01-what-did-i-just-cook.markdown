I just made some lunch for myself and it was stream-of-concsiousness cooking.


1. Cook some rice. 2 cups water to 1 cup rice. Cover, boil, stir, reduce the heat, and cover. Stir it up every 5 minutes, and cook for 15 minutes. I turned the heat all the way off for the last 5 minutes. Stir it again at the end, and remove it from the heat.

   While it's cooking, sort through a cupboard and get rid of old papers, booklets for appliances we no longer have, old take away menus for restaurants that no longer exist, and so on. Save some of the papers because they might be interesting (letters to Dad, a picture of Mom, some other stuff). Find an old non-stick pot with the non-stick scraped awah on the bottom and set aside for disposal.

1. Heat some oil in a big skillet (a non-stick if you have a good one).

1. Toss in some chopped onions (bought that way) and let soften.

1. Chop up some baby portabellas and toss them in.

1. Dice up 2 chicken thighs.

1. Finish up a bottle of crushed garlic (about 1 tsp) by tossing it in the pan.

1. Add 1/2 tsp of crushed bottled ginger root.

1. Stir them all around in the pan for a bit.

1. Toss in a handful of broccoli slaw.

1. Toss in a handful of shredded cabbage (cole slaw mix).

1. Push that shit around for awhile.

1. Finish up a bag of frozen mixed veggies (not very much).

1. Add a handful of frozen peas.

1. Splash in some rice vinegar.

1. Stir and cook.

1. Add some spices: curry powder, ground cloves, turmeric, and stir those in and let sit for a bit.

1. Make a hole in the mix, dump in the diced chicken. Salt & pepper the chicken, and cook.

1. As chicken is cooked, stir it into the veggies. Give this a good minute or so of stirring gently, from edges to center.

1. Dump in 1 cup of the cooked rice, and mix it in.

1. Add another splace of rice vinegar.

1. Finish off the bottle of tamari, maybe 2 ounces?

1. Give it 2 squirts of sesame oil, not a lot.

1. Stir it all together again, turn off the heat, cover and let sit for about 10 minutes.

1. Serve with a handful of dry roasted peanuts and a sprinkle of dried diced chives.

So, what would you call this? Maybe some kind of fried rice veggie and chicken stir fry??
