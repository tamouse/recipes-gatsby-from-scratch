A tasty baked chicken dish that our kids loved


## Ingredients
* 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
* 1/4 cup dijon mustard
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1 tablespoon tamari sauce
* 1/4 cup or so panko bread crumbs


## Directions

1.  Heat oven to 350&degF;

1.  Line a baking pan with foil

1.  Mix mustard, honey, and tamari sauce in one bowl

1.  Spread panko crumbs in another bowl

1.  Dip chicken pieces first in mustard mixture, making sure to coat it well

1.  Dredge dipped chicken pieces in crumbs, also making sure they are well coated

1.  Arrange coated chicken pieces in pan on foil

1.  Back at 350&degF; for 20-30 minutes



This dish is my favourite to accompany roasted brussels sprouts. They
can cook right alongside the sprouts after they've gone about 15-20
minutes at 400.
