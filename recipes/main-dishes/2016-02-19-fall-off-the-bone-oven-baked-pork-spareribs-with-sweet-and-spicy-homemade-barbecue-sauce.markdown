This looks like a super delightful recipe, and easy, too.

## Ingredients

* 1 rack (approx. 5 pounds) of pork spareribs or baby back ribs
* Commercial or [homemade barbecue sauce]({% post_url 2016-02-19-sweet-and-spicy-barbeque-sauce %}) -- look for gluten-free

### Dry Rub

* 1 teaspoon garlic salt
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 20 turns of the pepper grinder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 1 teaspoon oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon of white pepper
* 1/4 cup of brown sugar

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Ribs will cook for a total time of 4 hours.

1. Combine all of the dry rub ingredients in a small bowl.

1. Prepare the
   rack by removing the membrane from the back of the ribs and cutting
   away that extra little flap of tough meat across the top - just
   discard that or save for another use.

1. Line a baking pan with
   aluminum foil.

1. On the bottom side of the ribs, sprinkle on a
   generous amount of the dry rub and rub it in.

1. Set the ribs on the
   baking pan with the seasoned side down, and apply the remaining dry
   rub on the top side.

1. Roast uncovered at 250 degrees F for 2 hours.

### After the ribs have cooked for 2 hours

((whew))


1. Remove them from the oven and pour some
   of the sauce over the top of the ribs. Using a brush, gently spread
   the sauce all over the ribs.

1. Cover the entire pan tightly with
   aluminum foil and return to the oven, baking for an additional 2
   hours, or until the meat begins to pull away from the bone.

1. If you
   like, unwrap, brush with a bit of sauce and finish under the
   broiler for a minute or so.

1. When ready to serve, brush a little
   extra sauce on each serving but definitely serve with a side of
   sauce for dipping.
