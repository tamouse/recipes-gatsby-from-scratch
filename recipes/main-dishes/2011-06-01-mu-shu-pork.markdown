A Chinese favourite done easily.

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons minced fresh gingerroot
* 2 (4 ounce) boneless pork loin chops, cut into thin strips
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* 3 green onions, sliced
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 2 tbsp hoisin sauce
* 2 cups coleslaw mix with carrots
* 8 (8 inch) flour tortillas, warmed

## Directions

1.  In a large skillet, saute pork, ginger, green onions and garlic for 3-5 minutes or until meat is no longer pink.

1.  Stir in hoisin sauce. Add coleslaw mix; stir to coat. 

1. Cook and stir for a few more minutes.

1. Spread hoisin sauce on each tortilla.

1. Spoon about 1/2 cup pork mixture into the center of each tortilla; roll up tightly.

## Notes

I don't like to use thickeners in sauces, so I left out the cornstarch
preparation. I also put the ginger in with the pork and garlic to let
it cook and release more of it's flavours and permeate the dish. Next
time, I think I'd grate some more carrots to go with the cole slaw
mix. There just aren't enough in the mix. I'm also not a big fan of
using oil to cook, so I just spray the pan with Pam. 2 pork loin chops
were more than enough for 3 people as well.
