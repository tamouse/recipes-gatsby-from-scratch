Oh my, this was so good. This is now a go-to recipe for us. Consider
adding loose sausage instead of the eggs, or even chicken. Yum! This
is definitely one for the houseboat!

## Ingredients

-   3 Tbsp unsalted à«›utter, divided
-   1 Tbsp olive oil
-   2 large sweet onions, halved and sliced
-   Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
-   4 cups stemmed-ribboned kale leaves
-   5 cups cooked wild rice blend
-   2 cups (8 oz) grated Swiss cheese, divided
-   3/4 cup chicken broth
-   1 cup dry bread crumbs
-   8 large eggs (optional)

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 375&deg;F.

2.  Caramelize onions: Melt 1 Tbsp butter in oil in a large skillet over
    medium-low heat; add onions and season with 1/2 tsp salt and a little
    pepper; cook until onions are tender and sweet, stirring
    occasionally, about 30 minutes. Add kale and let wilt, about 5
    minutes. Combine onion-kale mixture, wild rice, and 1 cup grated
    cheese in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper, if needed.

3.  Assemble and bake: Grease a 2-quart baking dish with 1 Tbsp butter.
    Spread wild rice mixture into dish and pour broth over. Top with
    remaining 1 cup cheese. Melt remaining 1 Tbsp butter; toss with
    bread crumbs. Sprinkle over cheese. Bake until bubbly and brown on
    top, 30 to 35 minutes.

4.  If serving with eggs, bring a pot of water to boil. Add eggs and
    cook 5 to 6 minutes (for soft-boiled). Peel eggs under cool running
    water. Serve each portion with an egg. Add salt and pepper.
