This is on the "to try" list - I absolutely love bulgogi and Korean BBQ. I think I can do this at home to ensure no contamination.

# Bulgogi (Korean BBQ Beef)

## Ingredients

### Marinade
- 6 Tbsp tamari (gluten-free soy sauce)
- 3 Tbsp brown sugar
- 2 Tbsp rice wine (mirin)
- 1 red apple, tart and sweet, like a Cripps Pink or Gala, seeded/cored, chopped
- 1/2 small onion, chopped
- 1 Tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tsp minced ginger
- 1/8 tsp ground black pepper

### Main dish part

- 1.5 lb rib eye or top sirloin
- 1 small onion, thinly sliced (like from a mandoline)
- 2 stalks green onion, thinly sliced
- 1/2 carrot, peeled, thinly sliced diagonally
- 1 Tbsp sesame oil
- 1 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds
- 1 Tbsp cooking oil

## Directions

### Meat Prep

1. Wrap the meat in clear wrap and put on a baking sheet, freeze for 2 hours or so, so the meat is not frozen through, but can be sliced. This will enable the thinnest slices, necessary for bulgogi.
2. Slice the semi-frozen beef to narrow slices, 1/8 inch thick. Place the slices into a deep mixing bowl; prefer to use glass over plastic or metal.

### Marinade
1. Blend the marinade ingredients until smooth.
2. Pour the marinade over beef in the bowl. Mix them well together while gently massaging the meat with your hands.
3. Add the sesame oil and mix it into the meat.
4. Cover the bowl with clear wrap and marinate the meat for at least 4 hours, better if overnight, refridgerated.

### Main

5. Preheat a skillet to medium high heat until well heated. Add the cooking oil and spread it well.
6. Add the meat and vegetables and cook it on medium high to high heat for 3 to 5 mins until the meat and vegetables cook to desired doneness.
7. Toss in the sesame seeds and stir them quickly.


Serve the bulgogi with steamed rice and other Korean side dishes, like kim-chi, korean pickles, lettuce wraps, ["ssamjang" (a korean dipping sauce)](https://www.amazon.com/Chung-Jung-One-Sunchang-Seasoned/dp/B07BFQPCM6/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=ssam+sauce&qid=1571019198&sr=8-8)


Not necessarily knowing what to do with an extra half an onion, I might just put a whole one in the marinade, or only use the other half in the main part instead of a whole.
