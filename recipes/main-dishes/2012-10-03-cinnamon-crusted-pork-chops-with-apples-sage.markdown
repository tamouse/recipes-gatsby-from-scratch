Pork chops with applesauce has been a staple in many cultures; cooking
pork with apples and onions/shallots is a divine way to prepare this
meat. This recipe makes things go even better with the addition of
cinnamon and sage.

1.  Melt the remanding 1 tablespoons Coconut Oil in the fry pan.

1.  Place your Chops in fry pan.
