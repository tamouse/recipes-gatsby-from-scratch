A great dish, easily prepared, and can be combined with so many things.


## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon dried parsley, divided
* 1 tablespoon dried basil, divided
* 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
* 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 2 tomatoes, sliced


## Directions

1.  Heat oven to 350&degF; (175&degC).

1.  Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.

1.  Sprinkle 1 teaspoon parsley and 1 teaspoon basil evenly over the bottom of the baking dish.

1.  Arrange chicken breast halves in the dish, and sprinkle evenly with garlic slices.

1.  In a small bowl, mix the remaining 2 teaspoons parsley, remaining 2 teaspoons basil, salt, and red pepper; sprinkle over the chicken.

1.  Top with tomato slices.

1.  Bake covered in the preheated oven 25 minutes. Remove cover, and continue baking 15 minutes, or until chicken juices run clear. 

You might want to line the bottom of the cooking dish with foil, first. It helps the clean-up tremendously!
