A Minneapolis Star/Trib Taste section Sunday Supper selection from "The Brokeass Gourmet Cookbook," by Gabi Moskowitz.


Makes 8 mini-burgers.


## Ingredients
* 1/2 pound lean ground lamb *(since ground lamb is **so** expensive, I opted to use very lean ground beef instead, and it turned out great!)*
* 1/2 red onion, finely diced
* 1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, chopped
* 2 ounces crumbled feta cheese
* 3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for pan *(I omitted the oil entirely for this recipe)*
* 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped, divided
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1/4 cup Greek yogurt
* Juice and zest of 1/2 lemon
* 1/4 teaspoon dried dill
* 1 cup fresh spinach leaves
* 4 small pita rounds, halved


## Directions

1.  In a mixing bowl, combine lamb, onion, parsley, feta, 2 teaspoons olive oil, 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Very gently use hands to combine ingredients, being careful not to break the feta down. Form into 8 patties, about 2&frac12; inches wide. Set patties on a clean plate.

1.  Lightly brush a grill pan, regular pan or grill with enough olive oil to lightly grease it. Cook burgers to desired doneness (medium rare would be 2 to 3 minutes on each side). Remove from heat.

1.  Whisk together yogurt with remaining minced garlic clove, 1 teaspoon olive oil, lemon juice and zest, dill, salt and pepper to taste.

1.  To serve burgers, place a small handful of spinach into each pita half. Place burger in with the spinach and drizzle with the yogurt sauce. Serve immediately.
