This makes a very tasty, fall-off-the-bone, barbequed chicken done in the oven.

## Ingredients

* 1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces **or** 6 chicken thighs, skin taken off
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* prepared barbecue sauce (just use enough to coat each piece). Our favourite BBQ sauce is Rudolph's, from a restaurant in the Twin Cities.

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 350&degF; (175&degC).

1.  Place chicken in a shallow baking dish {+lined with foil+} and sprinkle with garlic powder. Cover and bake {-1 hour-} {+45 minutes+}.

1.  Remove baking dish from oven and drain any fat from dish. {-Pour-}{+Brush+} the barbecue sauce evenly over the chicken and bake uncovered for {-30-} {+15-20+} minutes. 

1.  Remove and serve.

Makes 6 servings for us.
