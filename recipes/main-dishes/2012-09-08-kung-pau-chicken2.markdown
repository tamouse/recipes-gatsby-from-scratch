## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
* 3&frac12; teaspoons cornstarch
* 1&frac14; pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into small chunks
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1&frac12; teaspoon Asian chili oil or sesame oil
* 3 tablespoon peanut oil
* 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 1 1&frac12;-inch piece of ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced
* 2 bunches scallions (whites cut in to &frac12;-inch pieces, greens sliced)
* 4 cups precut stir-fry vegetables
* &frac12; cup dry-roasted peanuts



## Directions

1.  Mix 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 2 teaspoons each rice wine, cornstarch, and water in a medium bowl. Add the chicken pieces and toss, cover and refrigerate until ready to use (at least 2 hours).

1.  Add the chicken and peanuts to the vegetables and stir-fry until the chicken is cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.

1.  Stir up the soy-chili sauce mixture, add to skillet/wok and cook until the sauce thickens, about 30 seconds.
