This sounds like a pretty awesome dish.

Since the chicken and everything is cooked in the oven as well as stir fried, *sure* not to overcook the chicken. This might be a good use for cubed rotisserie chicken, in which case you don't stir fry it at all, just add it to the mix as you're putting in the casserole dish.

## INGREDIENTS

- 1 lb boneless chicken thighs

## INGREDIENTS FOR STIR FRY SAUCE:

- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 2 tbsp chili garlic sauce/paste
- 2–3 tbsp gluten free Tamari soy sauce mixed with 1 tbsp dark sugar
- Pinch of ground ginger
- kefir lime or 1/4 tsp lime zest (a splash of juice works too)
- salt and pepper to taste
- (optional) finely diced Thai bird’s eye red pepper for extra spicy

## OTHER INGREDIENTS FOR THE CASSEROLE:

- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp garlic
- 1 cup stir fry veggies (i.e. broccoli, snap peas, etc.)
- 2–3 tbsp tapioca starch or potato starch/flour
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 16 oz (or about 3–4 c ) zucchini zoodles
- 3 eggs
- 2–3 tbsp coconut milk

- optional sesame seeds to garnish
