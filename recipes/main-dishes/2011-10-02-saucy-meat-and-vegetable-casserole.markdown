The name on this one is rather bland, but it sounds like a good recipe.

## Ingredients

* 1 pound ground beef
* 1 cup shredded zucchini
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
* 1/2 cup salsa
* 1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
* 1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 2 teaspoons white sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 cup butter
* 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 1 cup milk

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.

1.  In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef, onion, garlic, and marjoram. Drain the beef, and mix in the zucchini. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender. Mix in the salsa, tomato soup, and corn. Season with 1 teaspoon salt. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.

1.  In a medium bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, sugar, cream of tartar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and garlic powder. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the Cheddar cheese, sour cream, and milk. Spread over the beef mixture in the baking dish.

1.  Bake covered in the preheated oven 25 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

I think I might try other things in this as well: carrots, squash,
lima beans, peas, maybe even eggplant. Just using margoram seems a bit
thin on spices to me as well. I'd probably also add ground black
pepper, a bit of chili powder, maybe some cumen. Also, instead of
soup, I think tomato paste, milk, and some more spices would work
wonders.
