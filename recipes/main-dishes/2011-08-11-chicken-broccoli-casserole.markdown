I threw this together rather spontaneously tonight with things at hand. It's a pretty simple thing, probably can be the basis for something even better-er.


## Ingredients
* 2 large chicken breasts
* 2 large heads broccoli
* 1 large can french fried onion strips
* 1 can cream of mushroom soup
* 1 small can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
* 1/4 parmesan cheese
* salt and pepper
* thyme
* sage
* dry mustard
* monterey chicken spice blend


## Directions

1.  heat oven to 350&degF;

1.  cut up **chicken** into bite-sized pieces

1.  cut up **broccoli** into bite-sized pieces

1.  **sauté chicken**, sprinkling with monterey chicken seasoning, salt and pepper

1.  when chicken is part-way done, add drained can of mushroom pieces

1.  mix together cream of mushroom soup, thyme, sage, and dry mustard

1.  put **broccoli**, **chicken**, **mushrooms**, **soup and spice mix**, and half the can of french fried onions in a casserole dish

1.  add the parmesan cheese {-and white wine-}

1.  mix thoroughly

1.  cook at 350&degF; for 30-40 minutes, covered

1.  sprinkle remaining onion rings on top and cook uncovered an additional 15 minutes


Okay, this didn't turn out quite as well as I'd hoped. Everyone agreed
it tasted good, but it wasn't very spectacular. It may have cooked too
long as the broccoli was rather overdone. Next time I think I'll try
green beans instead of broccoli. Also, the spicing wasn't quite
right. Given the salt content of the canned soup and the onion rings,
no additional salt needed to be added. The Thyme and Sage didn't
really work too well either, perhaps they needed more time to bloom
effectively.

I think the wine is what made this recipe **not** work. Suggestion to
omit from recipe and provide a wine sauce to add upon serving.

## Variations

Here are the alterations I'd make:

* 1/2 can of the mushroom soup for these amounts instead of a whole can.
* Use only 1/2 the can of onion rings instead of the whole can (or use the smaller can instead of the larger can).
* omit salting the chicken while it's cooking.
* Omit the Thyme and Sage. Try it with Rosemary (not very much!)
* Add a little garlic powder.
* Cook it for less time (30 minutes first part, 10 minutes second part).
* Try fresh green beans instead of broccoli.
* Used grated cheddar instead of grated parmesan.

Some other possibilities:

* use cheddar cheese instead or in addition to parmesan
* use cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom
* use bread crumbs or cracker crumbs instead of onion rings (if i did this, i'd also sauté onions while cooking the chicken)
* use a seasoned bread stuffing, maybe 2 cups
* possibly make a cornbread stuffing and mix it in with the casserole(?)
* can vary the spices tremendously with this dish, I think. Basil/Oregano, or Rosemary, or even go for Cardamom, Cumin, or Curry. Could also go hot with Cayenne, Chili, Pepper Sauce, etc.
