Try this garlic scape pancakes recipe from Kitchen Vignettes. These
flaky pancakes are a great appetizer or side dish from PBS Food.

##  Ingredients

###  Pancakes:

* 1 cup whole spelt flour (optional, use white flour if you prefer)
* 1 1/2 cup unbleached white flour
* 1/2 cup boiling water
* 1/2 cup cold water
* 1/2 tbsp. baking powder
* 1 tsp. sea salt
* 1/4 cup toasted sesame seed oil
* 2 cups finely chopped garlic scapes

###  Dipping Sauce:

* 3 tbsp. organic soy or tamari sauce
* 3 tbsp. rice vinegar
* 1 to 2 tsp. freshly grated ginger
* 1 tsp. sesame oil
* 1 tsp. sugar or honey
* A pinch of dried chili flakes (optional)

###  For frying:

* About 1/4 cup grapeseed or peanut oil

##  Directions

1.  Mix the spelt and white flours together with the salt. Put half of the mixture in one bowl and half in another bowl.

1.  In one bowl add 1/2 cup boiling water. Mix with a wooden spoon until the dough can handled. Knead for 2 minutes in the bowl.

1.  In the other bowl, mix the baking powder into the flour. Add the cold water and mix with a wooden spoon until dough can be handled. Knead for 2 minutes in the bowl.

1.  Incorporate both doughs together by kneading them into one another for 5 minutes on a lightly floured surface. This dough is very forgiving. If its too dry, simply add a bit of water. If it's too sticky, simply add a bit of flour. The dough should feel nice and moist but not stick to your hands.

1.  Shape into a ball, and place in a bowl with a damp towel on top and let it rest at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours.

1.  Cut the dough into 4 pieces.

1.  Roll each one into a thin 9 or 10 inch circle.

1.  Brush with one tablespoon of sesame oil and sprinkle with about 1/2 cup of garlic scapes, evenly distributed over the surface.

1.  Roll the dough into a tight cylinder and pinch in the edges to seal. Coil this cylinder into a spiral and tuck in the end. Flatten it into a disc with the palm of your hand. Roll this out into a flat pancake, about 1/4 inch thick. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Let the 4 pancakes rest for about 10 minutes before frying.

1.  Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce by whisking all ingredients together.

1.  Heat about 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy skillet on medium heat. When the oil is hot, gently place the pancake into the pan and cook on each side for about 2 to 3 minutes or until nice and golden. Repeat with remaining pancakes. Cut the pancakes into wedges and serve hot, with the dipping sauce.


##  Tips/Techniques

If you wish to keep your pancakes warm, place them on a baking sheet in a 200 F oven. However, they are best when served straight off the skillet.
