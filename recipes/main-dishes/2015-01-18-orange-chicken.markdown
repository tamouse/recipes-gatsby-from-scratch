A good orange chicken should have just that little bit of sweetness
and tanginess to it without being completely overpowering. It should
also have that beautiful, slightly sticky gloss and marinade that
perfectly coats the chicken. Most orange chicken recipes will have you
fry the chicken first to get it nice and crispy,&nbsp;but if you want
to make this dish healthier, skip the breading and the frying. Cook
the chicken pieces in a skillet, then pour the sauce over and let the
chicken and sauce boil until you get that perfect gloss.

## Ingredients

### Marinade

<ul>
<li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
<li>1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
<li>1/2 cup&nbsp;honey</li>
<li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
<li>1/4 cup rice wine vinegar</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 tablespoon orange zest</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Sriracha (or to taste)</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon ground or grated ginger</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper</li>
</ul>

### The rest

<ul>
<li>1 1/2 lbs boneless chicken breasts cut into 1" chunks</li>
<li>1 cup and 2 tablespoons cornstarch, divided</li>
<li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
<li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
</ul>

## Directions

<ol>

<li>Make the marinade: whisk together chicken broth, orange juice,
honey, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, orange zest, sriracha, ginger, and
white pepper in a bowl.</li>

<li>In a large zipper-lock bag or lage bowl, combine the chicken and
2/3 cup of the marinade. Marinate the chicken for at least 30 minutes,
turning the bag occasionally. Drain the chicken from the marinade and
discard the marinade.</li>

<li>Heat the remaining mardinade in a medium saucepan over medium
heat. Bring the marinade to a boil. Stir together 2 tablespoons of
cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water, then stir that into the
marinade. Cook, stirring frequently, until thickened (about 1-2
minutes. Keep warm.</li>

<li>One at a time, dip the chicken into the beaten eggs, then dredge
in the remaining 1 cup cornstarch, pressing in to coat.</li>

<li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan. In batches, add the
chicken and fry until golden brown and cooked through (about 1-2
minutes). Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, then discard the
excess oil. Serve the chicken immediately, tossed with the marinade
and garnished with sesame seeds.</li>
