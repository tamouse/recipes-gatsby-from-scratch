This was a winner of a recipe. I substituted 1/2 cup of red wine for
some of the beef broth. (Who wouldn't??) We had this two nights
running and the "ummmmmms" and "oooooos" around the table were pretty
awesome.

> *Note: Using good paprika is the key to this dish. We tend to think of
paprika as something you sprinkle on top of deviled eggs and potato
salad, but high-quality paprika has a wonderful flavor all its own and
adds a deep earthiness to this goulash. This version uses both sweet
Hungarian paprika and smoked Spanish paprika for a slight twist on a
traditional family favorite. From Meredith Deeds.*

## Ingredients

* 2 lb. boneless chuck, trimmed and cut into 2-in. cubes
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
* 2 tbsp. olive oil
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, chopped
* 1/4 c. flour
* 2 tbsp. Hungarian sweet paprika
* 2 tbsp. smoked paprika
* 1 tsp. caraway seeds
* 2 tbsp. tomato paste
* 2 c. low-sodium beef broth
* 2 red bell peppers, finely diced
* 4 c. cooked egg noodles
* 2 tbsp. chopped fresh parsley
* 1/2 c. low-fat sour cream

## Directions

1. Season the beef with salt and pepper. In a large skillet over
medium-high heat add the oil and then add half of the beef. Don't
overcrowd or beef will not brown properly. Brown the beef on all sides,
about 3 minutes a side. Transfer to slow cooker. Repeat with the
remaining beef.

2. Lower the heat to medium and add the onions. Cook until softened, about
6 minutes. Add the garlic, flour, both varieties of paprika and caraway
seeds. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning. Add
the tomato paste and cook for another minute.

3. Whisk in the beef broth and scrape the bottom of the skillet to release
all the browned bits. Pour mixture into the slow cooker and add the bell
pepper. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours.

4. Ladle into heated serving bowls over the egg noodles, and garnish with
the parsley and sour cream.
