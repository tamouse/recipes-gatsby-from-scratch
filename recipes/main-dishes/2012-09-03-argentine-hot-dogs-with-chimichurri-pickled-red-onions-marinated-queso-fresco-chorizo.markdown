It's nearing the end of summer, and you've probably had your share of
hot dogs, but these Argentine dogs are as far from yellow mustard and
ketchup as you can get.

## For the Chimichurri:

### ingredients

- 1/2 a bunch of parsley, chopped
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- Juice of 1 small lemon
- 1 TBS. red wine vinegar
- 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes
- 1/4 tsp. crushed garlic
- 1/4 cup finely diced red and yellow peppers
- 2 tablespoons grated carrot

### directions

* Make the chimichurri. Combine the first six ingredients in a food processor; pulse to pesto-like consistency. Season to taste with salt. Fold in peppers and carrot. Set aside. Can be made several hours ahead. Cover and chill. Take out of refrigerator 1 hour before serving.

## For the Pickled Red Onions:

### ingredients

- 1/2 red onion, sliced
- 2 TBS. white wine vinegar (or champagne vinegar)
- agave nectar to taste
- Kosher salt to taste

### directions

* To make the pickled onions, place the sliced onions in a bowl and add the vinegar. Add a good drizzle of agave nectar (or you can use honey or sugar) and season with a little salt. Stir to combine. Taste and add more sweetener if needed. Cover and refrigerate overnight.



## For the Marinated Queso Fresco:

- 4 ounces queso fresco, crumbled
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon crushed garlic
- Zest from 1/2 lemon
- Salt, pepper to taste

### directions

* Combine the marinated queso fresco ingredients. Cover and refrigerate overnight.


## To Assemble:

1. 2 grilled beef hot dogs 

1. 1 sweet or sour steak roll &ndash; cut in half lengthwise, with a slit cut into each half to form 2 hot dog buns

1. 4 ounces ground chorizo, cooked

* Lightly toast the buns on the grill, grill the hot dogs, and top with cooked, crumbled chorizo, chimichurri, pickled red onions, and marinated queso fresco.
