A very differently flavoured meatloaf than the usual American style. This is a bit like a loaf of gyros.

## Ingredients

### MEATLOAF:

* 1 1/2 lbs. ground lamb
* 1 1/2 lbs. ground beef
* 2 eggs
* 1/4 c. milk
* 2 c. quick oats
* 2 tbsp. oil
* 1 lg. onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, mashed
* 1 c. parsley, chopped
* 1 tsp. cumin

### FILLING:

* 1 lg. bunch spinach, chopped
* 1 beaten egg
* 1 1/2 c. feta cheese, crumbled

### TOPPING:

* 1/2 c. catsup
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* 3 tbsp. Parmesan cheese

## Directions:

Mix meats. Beat eggs in small bowl with milk and oats. Let stand 5
minutes. Saute onion and garlic in oil. Combine all the meatloaf
ingredients. Mix all the filling ingredients together. Put 2/3 of meat
mixture in the shape of hollow loaf in pan. Fill with the filling and
top with remaining meat. Spoon topping over meatloaf. Bake at 350
degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let stand before serving.
