This is a traditional Alsacian recipe, rather simplified here, but oh so delicious

## Ingredients

* 4-6 pork loin chops, boneless
* 1 pound of sauerkraut
* 4-6 medium potatoes
* 1-2 medium onions
* 1-2 medium apples
* 1/2 cup white wine (I usually use Gewertztrameiner or Reisling)
* salt and pepper
* carraway seeds

## Directions

1.  Heat oven to 350°F

1.  Season pork chops with salt and pepper, both sides

1.  Peel and slice onion

1.  Slice apple

1.  Peel and cube potatoes

1.  Rinse and drain the sauerkraut. Mix in carroway seeds

1.  Sautée onion and apple for a few minutes in a pan

1.  Add pork chops and sear well on both sides

1.  In a dutch oven or covered casserole dish, put potatoes, onion, apple and pork chops in the bottom

1.  Put the sauerkraut over the top

1.  Pour in the wine

1.  Season to taste

1.  Cover and place in the oven for 50-60 minutes

One time I didn't have any carroway seeds, so instead I used sage, thyme and paprika as seasoning. If I'd had any rosemary, I'd have used that as well.

Jaques Pépin has a fantastic [[http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/choucroute-garnie|Choucroute Garnie]] recipe that involves using pork ribs, kielbasa sausage, skinless hot dogs and baked ham in the dish.
