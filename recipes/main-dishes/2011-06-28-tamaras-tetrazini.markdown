I get asked to make this a lot. Before I knew what it was called, I called it "Wild Turkey Surprise." Now I know better and it's actually got some legitimacy to it. The basic recipe here started with a recipe from a Sunset magazine cookbook, Favorite Recipes. I've modified since then.


## Ingredients

* 2 large skinless boneless chicken breasts, preferrably thawed, or 2 cups cooked turkey.
* `McCormick Monterey Chicken Seasoning, or similar stuff to season chicken or turkey.
* 1 tablespoon crushed garlic.
* 1/4 cup white wine (a good gevurtz is wonderful in this)
* a cup of [alfredo sauce]
* 1 larger can of mushrooms, sliced and pieces.
* 3 ounces of pasta, long noodles the best.
* 8 oz frozen peas.
* ground nutmeg.
* thai chili paste (very optional).

## Directions

1.  Cut up chicken into bite-sized pieces. 

1. In a pan, spray with oil if desired (I often cook this dish with no oil whatsoever), cook garlic, chicken and mushroom pieces, seasoning chicken pieces with the monterey spice blend. After the chicken has cooked a bit, add the white wine.

1. Separately, start a large pot of water boiling. When it has reached a rolling boil, add the pasta and peas together. Bring the water back to rolling boil and cook for 8 minutes.

1. Also separately, start preparing the [alfredo sauce]. Add the nutmeg to the sauce as it's thickening.

1. %When everything is done, combine all together, mixing well and serve immediately.

## Comments

When I'm making this for other people, which is often, I don't put in the thai chili sauce. I just do that for me. It makes things really pop.

## Variations

I've heard that some recipes for tetrazini call for some kind of nuts, such as slivered almonds or something like that. I may have to try that, but I'm not sure at which stage to add them.
