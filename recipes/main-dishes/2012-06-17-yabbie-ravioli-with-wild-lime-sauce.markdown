[Yabbies] are a crayfish-like freshwater crustacean from Australia

## Ravioli

* 30 yabbies (5 portions)
* 100g leeks, julienne cut
* wine glass of Vermouth
* salt and pepper
* 60 wonton skins
* egg white

Drop the live yabbies into a large volume of boiling water to quickly
kill them. Drain and transfer to iced water to chill totally. Remove
the flesh from the tail and discard the alimentary canal. Sauté the
julienne leek in a little butter, add the yabby tails and
Vermouth. Toss frequently until all the liquid has evaporated and
flavoured the yabbies which should be half cooked at this
stage. Remove yabbies and leeks and set aside to cool. Place one yabby
tail and a little of the leek onto a wonton wrapper. Brush the wrapper
around the yabby with egg white and set another wonton skin on top of
the yabby squeezing out any gaps. Using a round cutter, cut out a
circle keeping the yabby in the centre or alternatively, leave
square. Put aside under a damp tea towel until ready to cook.

## Oz lemon cream sauce
* 50g onion fine diced
* butter
* 70ml seafood stock
* 150ml Riesling
* 1 litre cream
* 1 teaspoons ground Oz lemon

Saut&eacute; the onion in a little butter until soft. Add the stock
and wine and reduce until nearly dry. Add the cream and reduce by
half. Strain through a fine strainer, return to the pan and season to
taste. Remove from heat, add the lemon myrtle and whisk in a little
cold butter before serving.

## Garnish
* 15 small shiitake mushrooms
* 30 small Wild limes
* butter
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar
* a pinch of salt

Saut&eacute; the whole mushrooms and 6 small limes in a little
butter. Add the sugar, salt and the remainder of the limes towards the
end.

To finish the dish, drop the ravioli into boiling salted water for 1
to 2 minutes until the wonton skin edges are *al dent&eacute;*. Drain
and set in a ring on a plate. Pile sautéed mushrooms and limes in the
centre of the ring and dress with the cream sauce. Top with a sprig of
fresh herb.
