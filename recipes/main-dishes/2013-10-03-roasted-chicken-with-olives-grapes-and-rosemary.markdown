Another recipe my mom found for us to try. It sounds good, except the
olives. :P If I'm making this, I'm leaving out the olives.



## Ingredients

-   3 lb bone-in skin-on chicken parts (thighs, drumsticks, and/or
    breasts)
-   Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
-   1 Tbsp olive oil
-   1 cup seedless grapes
-   1 cup pitted kalamata olives
-   2 shallots, sliced
-   1 Tbsp chopped fresh rosemary
-   1/2 cup dry white wine
-   1/2 cup chicken broth

## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 450&deg;F.

2.  Pat chicken dry and season generously with salt and pepper. Warm oil
    in a heavy, ovenproof 12-inch skillet (cast- iron if you've got it)
    over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Working in 2 batches, brown
    chicken, flipping once, about 5 minutes per batch, transferring
    first batch to a plate while second batch browns. I take a lot of
    care in this step, not moving chicken until skin releases itself and
    is nicely bronzed.

3.  Return all chicken to pan, skin side up, and surround with grapes,
    olives, shallots, and rosemary. Roast chicken until just cooked
    through and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. 4. Transfer chicken,
    grapes, and olives to a platter, then add wine and chicken broth to
    juices in skillet over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, scraping
    up any brown bits, and cook until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes.
    Strain sauce and pour over chicken, if desired. (See how long it
    takes guests to offer to slurp up sauce with a spoon.)
