Traditional Tuesday night supper when I was growing up.

## Ingredients

* medium onion, peeled and diced
* 1 or 2 cloves garlic, peeled, minced or crushed
* 1/2 cup mushrooms, sliced or chopped
* 3/4 pound ground beef, turkey, veal, etc. (A good mince)
* salt, pepper, other seasonings to taste. [^ I have  variously tried: dried mustard, wet mustard, basil,  oregano, ginger, chili powder, ketchup, bbq sauce, or whatever I feel the urge to toss in. Some of these have met with more or less success. ^]
* 1 can cream of mushroom soup [^it wouldn't be a hot dish without cream of mushroom soup!^]
* (optional) 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese
* 15-20 frozen tater tots [^I recently did this with frozen sweet potato fries and it came out quite nice.^]


## Directions

1.  heat oven to 350&degF;

1.  in a skillet, over medium-high heat, salut&eacute; the onion, garlic and mushrooms until soft. [^Sometimes, I've carmelised the onions first, depending on how much time I have.^]

1.  add the mince and seasonings, brown the meat thoroughly

1.  take off the heat and mix in `CoM soup

1.  pour meat mixture into 9x9 pan
