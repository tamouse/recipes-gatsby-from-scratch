Your bog-standard meatloaf


## Ingredients

* 1.5 pounds ground beef
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 egg
* 2 tablespoons malt-o-meal
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* fresh ground pepper

## Glaze

* 1/3 cup ketchup
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon yellow mustard

## Directions

1.  mix gently with as few strokes as possible to combine everything

1.  fill a bread loaf pain

1.  bake 45 minutes at 350°F

1.  mix together glaze

1.  drain fat from pan, coat meatloaf with glaze, bake 20 minutes longer at 350°F


Makes 6 servings.

Baked potatoes cook at a higher temperature than the meatloaf does, so
if you cook them together, you need to cook the potatoes longer. I put
the oven up to 450&degF; to start the potatoes, prepare the meatloaf,
then lower the temp back down to 350 before putting the meatloaf
in. If the potatoes aren't *too* large, they'll all be done at the
same time.
