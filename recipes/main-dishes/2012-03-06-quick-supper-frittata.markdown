A nice frittata recipe.

## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons oil
* 2 to 3 small Yukon gold, red-skinned or round white potatoes, unpeeled, cut into 1/4 -in. dice
* 1/4 cup chopped red onion
* a dash of  coarse salt
* 1/8 tsp. smoked paprika
* 1 broccoli top, cut into 1-in. pieces
* 4 eggs
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 1/8 cup grated Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano or other cheeses.


## Directions
1.  Heat the bottom of a frittata pan over medium heat until hot. Add oil. When oil is hot enough to sizzle a piece of potato, spread potatoes in pan. Cook potatoes, turning occasionally with a wide spatula, until they are evenly browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Sprinkle potatoes with salt and paprika.

1.  Meanwhile, bring medium saucepan half full of water to a boil. Add broccoli and cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water and shake dry. Add broccoli to frittata pan, distributing them evenly on top of potatoes.

1.  In small bowl, whisk the eggs, 2 tablespoons water and a grinding of black pepper until frothy. Pour eggs over vegetables. Sprinkle cheese on top.

1.  Cook over medium to medium-low heat, tilting pan to allow uncooked eggs in the center to run under the set eggs around the edges, for 5 minutes.

1.  Heat the top of the frittata pan and spray with cooking oil. When hot, put on top of bottom frittata pan and invert on burner. Cook until eggs are evenly set, 3 to 5 minutes more. Cut into wedges and serve directly from the pan.

Portions reduced to fit smaller frittata pan. Serves 3 well.
