Frittatas are like fancy omelettes with potatoes. This one is very tasty. This recipe came out of a Williams-Sonoma catalog, which coincidently is where we purchased the frittata pan...

## Ingredients

* 2 large or 3 smaller russet potatoes, 1.25 pound total, scrubbed, cut into 1" dice.
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
* 4 thick bacon slices, cut into 3/4" dice
* 4 eggs
* 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
* 2 teaspoon fresh chives, minced
* 1/4 cup sour cream

## Directions

1.  Heat oven to 400&degF; (500&degF; was *way* to hot for our oven; I reduced the temp to 400&degF; which was much better.)

1.  In a bowl, combine potatoes, oil, salt and pepper. Transfer to baking sheet; bake, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 30 minutes. Let cool 30  minutes. (I don't bother letting the potatoes cool. I prepare everything else while the pototoes are baking.)

1.  In deep half of frittata pan over medium-high heat, cook bacon until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Discard fat. 

1.  Finely chop 2 tablespoons of bacon, reserve for garnish.

1.  In large bowl, whisk eggs, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese and 1 teaspoon of the chives.

1.  In deep half of frittata pan over medium heat, add potatoes and diced bacon to pan. Pour in the egg mixture.

1.  Cook, using spatula to lift the edges and allow uncooked egg to flow under, about 2 minutes, then cook 4-5 minutes more.

1.  Lightly brush the shallow half of frittata pan with remaining oil, heat over medium heat. Place shallow pan over deep pan and flip contents into shallow pan.

1.  Cook, shallow side down, covered, until eggs are set, about 3 minutes.

1.  Uncover pan, sprinkle frittata with cheese.

1.  Bake frittata for 4 minutes

1.  Slide onto serving plate, garnish with extra bacon and chives, serve with sour cream.

## Variations

I added saut&eacute;ed fresh mushrooms, cooked in a little bit of the bacon drippings.

It's perfectly okay to use a couple of green onions instead of the chives.

For extra zest, you can add italian herbs, paprika or what-have-you to both the potatoes and the egg mixture (just don't overdo it!).
