This pizza has a crust made with zucchini! This should be celiac-friendly (gluten-free).


## Ingredients

* 5 cups shredded zuchini
* 1 cup shredded Mozzarella
* 1 cup shredded Cheddar sheese
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 12 ounces tomato sauce
* 2 teaspoon oregano
* 1 bell pepper, chopped
* 1/4 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
* 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese
* Fresh tomato slices 


## Directions

1.  Squeese out moisture from zuchinni. Must get all moisture out or crust will be watery. I let the shredded zuchini drain in a colandar for about an hour pressing the water out until very dry. *(Can add salt to the zucchini to extract the moisture faster)*

1.  Mix the shredded zuchini with 1/2 cup of each of the cheeses and eggs. Press mixture into greased jelly roll pan to form the crust. Bake at 400 degrees for 8-10 minutes.

1.  Top the crust with the remaining ingredients. Bake 10-15 minutes more or until hot and bubbly. Very Good
