A simple sauce to go with a simple crust.

ingredients
-----------

-   One 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes
-   2 anchovies
-   2 garlic cloves
-   6 tablespoons olive oil
-   1/4 cup basil leaves
-   Salt
-   Pepper
-   12 ounces fresh mozzarella, grated
-   [Grandma-Style Pizza Dough]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-11-14-grandma-pizza %})

preparation
-----------

Drain one 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes and pulse tomatoes with 2
anchovies, 2 garlic cloves, 6 tablespoons olive oil, and 1/4 cup basil
leaves in a food processor or blender until mostly smooth (some texture
is okay); season with salt and pepper.

## Put It All Together:

A classic Grandma - just sauce and mozzarella - flips the usual script:
Add cheese before sauce. Master this basic pie and you're ready to
improvise (see below for ideas).

## Classic Mozzarella Pie:

Place a rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 525&degF; or as high
as oven will go.

Once Grandma-Style Pizza Dough has risen on baking sheet, top with 12
ounces fresh mozzarella, grated, and dot pie with 1 1/2 cups Fresh
Tomato Pizza Sauce. Bake pie until golden brown and crisp on bottom and
sides, 20 to 30 minutes.

## That Topping Game

When it comes to toppings, restraint is key. "It's all about ratio,"
Pinello says. "You want them to work with the crust, the sauce, the
cheese - in balance." We'll even lose the sauce sometimes to make white
pies. At right, find four of our favorite ways to go Grandma.

-   Provolone, Red Onion, Black Olives
-   Roasted Cauliflower, Ricotta, Breadcrumbs
-   Mozzarella, Fennel, Spicy Soppressata
-   Marinated Tuscan Kale, Ricotta, Mozzarella
