This pizza's crust is made entirely of meat, therefor it is lower carb, gluten-free and celiac friendly. 



## Ingredients

* 1 pound ground beef
* 1 pound sausage
* 1 cup pizza sauce (See HomeMadePizzaSauce)
* 3-4 cups mozzarella cheese (shredded)
* Pepperoni slices
* Onions, Peppers, etc.


## Directions

1.  Heat oven to 350&degF; (175&degC)

1.  Brown ground beef and sausage.

1.  Put beef/sausage mix in a large bowl and mix well with 2 cups of mozzarella cheese.

1.  Put mixture on a cookie sheet.

1.  Place foil on rack below to catch drippings.

1.  Add pizza sauce on the mixture. (Ragu is ok.) (Use pizza sauce with no sugar in it. See HomeMadePizzaSauce.)

## Comments
It may be necessary to add egg to the ground beef, sausage and mozzarella cheese mixture for a binding agent.
