Although this is a real cholesterol bomb, it is celiac-friendly -- no gluten products used at all!


## Ingredients

* Sliced pepperoni
* Thinly sliced Roma tomatoes
* 1 teaspoon oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon onion salt
* 1 cup sliced green pepper
* 1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms
* 1 hefty layer of mozzarella cheese
* parmesan cheese


## Directions

1.  Heat oven to 350&degF;.

1.  Put a layer of pepperoni down in an oven-safe dish (a glass pie pan works great for this!)

1.  Put a layer of Roma tomatoes over the pepperoni.

1.  Sprinkle the seasonings over the tomatoes.

1.  Top with seasoning, green pepper, mushrooms.

1.  Top with the mozzarella cheese, sprinkle on parmesan.

1.  Bake at 350&degF; for 15 mins.


This pizza is rather difficult to serve. You have to cut it in the
cooking dish, which is why I suggest a glass pie dish.
