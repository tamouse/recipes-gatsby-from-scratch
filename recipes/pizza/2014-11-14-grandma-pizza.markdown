Simple pizza crust you bake on a baking sheet.

ingredients
-----------

- 1 envelope active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons)
- 1 1/2 cups warm water (105 to 110&degF;)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus 1/2 cup
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 cups all-purpose flour

preparation
-----------

Combine 1 envelope active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons) and 1 1/2
cups warm water (105 to 110&degF;) in a large bowl; let stand until yeast starts
to foam, about 10 minutes.

Mix in 2 tablespoons olive oil, then 2 cups all-purpose flour and 2
teaspoons kosher salt. Add another 2 cups all-purpose flour, a cup at a
time, mixing until incorporated and a shaggy dough forms.

Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until soft,
smooth, and elastic, 10-12 minutes. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl
and cover with plastic wrap. Chill 24 hours.

Coat an 18x13in rimmed baking sheet with 1/2 cup olive oil.

Gently and gradually stretch dough until it reaches the edges of baking
sheet. (If dough springs back or is stiff to work with, let it rest 10
minutes before continuing. You may need to let it rest more than once.)

Cover dough on baking sheet tightly with plastic wrap and let sit in a
warm place (but not too warm! About 70&degF; is ideal for yeast to grow)
until it is puffed and full of air bubbles, 30-40 minutes.
