I don't remember where I found this, but using a huge portabella mushroom cap as the pie crust is awesome!

## Ingredients

* 1 large portobello mushroom, stem removed
* 1 tablespoon spaghetti sauce
* 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese
* 4 slices pepperoni sausage
* 1 clove garlic, chopped

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375&#x2109; (190&#x2103;).

1. Place the mushroom on a baking sheet, and bake for 5 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from the oven, and spread spaghetti sauce in the cup of the cap. Top with cheese, olives, pepperoni and garlic.

1. Bake for an additional 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted and golden.
