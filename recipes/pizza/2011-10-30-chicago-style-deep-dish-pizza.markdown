A fair rendition of that wonderful windy city dish

From the Caer Llewys Cookbook


## Ingredients
* [Pizza Crust]
* Various meats
* [Home Made Pizza Sauce] -- lots of it!
* Various cheeses


## Directions

* Heat oven to 375&degF;.

* For a Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, line a round baking tin, ten to
  twelve inches wide by about an inch and a half deep, with a thin
  layer of pizza crust, reserving a little of the dough.

* Fill the crust generously with meats, sauce and cheese to about a
  quarter to half an inch from the top, finishing up with sauce and
  cheese.  Save a little of the sauce for the top crust.

* Roll the reserved dough out into a very thin layer and cover the
  fillings with it.

* Seal around the edge of the top crust, then put a final thin layer
  of sauce and cheese on top of the top crust.

* Bake for about 25-30 minutes, and allow to rest for at least ten
  minutes before removing from the pan and cutting.
