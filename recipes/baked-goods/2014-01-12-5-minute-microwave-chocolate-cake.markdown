Fast and easy. Cake.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup (3 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) granulated sugar, divided
* 3/4 cup (2 1/4 ounces) cocoa, divided
* 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/4 plus 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 2 large egg yolks
* 6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter, melted
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips
* 1 cup warm water

## Directions

1. Combine flour, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons cocoa, 1/2 cup sugar,
baking powder, and salt in a 1 1/2 quart shallow microwave safe dish.

2. Add egg yolks, butter, vanilla, chocolate chips, and water to the
mix, and stir until almost combined (batter will be lumpy). Stir
remaining 2 tablespoons cocoa and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a small
bowl and sprinkle over batter.

3. Microwave on high power until puffed, bubbling, and set (but still
slightly jiggles), 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully remove from microwave and
serve warm.
