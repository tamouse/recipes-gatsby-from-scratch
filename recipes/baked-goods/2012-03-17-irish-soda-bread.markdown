This recipe looks so simple, and looks so NOMMY! It originally came
from "Cooking with Julia" and was posted at
[foodbuzz]({{page.external_url}}). This will be my first foray into
baking something more complex than drop biscuits, cake or
cookies. This looks easy enough that I'm sure it will turn out!


## Ingredients

* 4 Cups Flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 2 cups Buttermilk


## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 375&degF;. Make sure to position your rack in the middle of the oven.

1.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This way you don't have to grease a pan. You can just put the dough right onto the sheet. Set this aside.

1.  In a large bowl put together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir together with a fork until all ingredients are incorporated. Add the buttermilk and stir vigorously until the dough comes together.

1.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (keep some extra flour handy this dough is VERY sticky). Knead the dough gently for a minute. Do not knead too much! The dough should be soft and malleable.

1.  Pat the dough into a disk about 6 inches across and slash and X across the top of the dough. The X should be about 1/2 an inch deep. I know that seems a bit deep, but do it, you will see what it does when it bakes. Place the dough onto the baking sheet.

1.  Bake the dough for about 50 minutes or until the dough is golden brown on top. Transfer it to a rack to cool for a few minutes and then slice. Serve warm.

> Now, because of the low fat content in the bread it doesn't last
  very long. Will be as hard as a blarney stone in 2 days so make sure
  if you make this you plan on eating all of it, or plan on throwing
  some out for your birds to enjoy. I have found that if you put it
  away immediately after dinner (possibly while still a little warm),
  it will last about 2 days. That 3rd day though? Forget it!

This will be my first foray into baking, when I make this. I'm looking
forward to it!
