From Martha Stewart's site. This pie dough is used in the [Apple Crostata] recipe

Ingredients
-----------

-   2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
-   Salt
-   2 sticks cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
-   1/4 to 1/2 cup ice water
-   1 cup shredded sharp white cheddar cheese

Directions
----------

1.  Pulse flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor until combined.
    Add butter, and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal, about 10
    seconds. Drizzle 1/4 cup water evenly over mixture. Pulse until
    mixture just begins to hold together (dough should not be wet or
    sticky). If dough is too dry, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a
    time, and pulse. Add cheese; pulse until combined.

2.  Shape dough into 2 disks, and wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate
    until chilled, about 30 minutes or up to overnight.


Dough can be frozen for up to 1 month. Thaw before using.
