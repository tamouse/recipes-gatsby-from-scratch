"Lamingtons are little sponge cakes coated in chocolate and grated coconut. A traditional Australian treat that appeals to most. Any firm type of plain cake can be used: butter-cake, pound-cake, Madeira cake or genoise sponge."


## Ingredients

### Cake

* 1/2 cup butter
* 3/4 cup white sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 eggs
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup milk

### Icing

* 4 cups confectioners' sugar
* 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 2 tablespoons butter, melted
* 1/2 cup milk

### Topping

* 2 (8 ounce) packages flaked coconut. [-Note: desiccated coconut is a slightly dried shredded coconut - not sweetened.-]

## Directions

### Cake

1.  Heat oven to 375&degF;.
1.  Grease and flour an 8x12 inch rectangular pan.

1.  Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

1.  In a large bowl, cream together the 1/2 cup butter, 3/4 cup sugar and the vanilla until light and fluffy.
1.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition.
1.  Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk; beat well.

1.  Pour the batter into the 8x12 inch pan.
1.  Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean.
1.  Let stand 5 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
1.  Store overnight to give the cake a chance to firm up before Icing.

### Icing

1.  In a large bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and cocoa.
1.  In a saucepan, heat milk and 2 teaspoons butter until the butter is melted.
1.  Add the milk to the sugar mixture and mix well to create a fluid, but not too runny, Icing.

### Assmbly

*The Icing will drip, so place a sheet of parchment paper under the rack to catch the drips.*

1.  Cut the cake into 24 squares.
1.  Place coconut in a shallow container.
1.  Using a fork, dip each square into the icing, then roll it in the coconut.
1.  Place onto rack to dry.
1.  Continue for each piece.
