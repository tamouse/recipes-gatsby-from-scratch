Beer and rye complement each other well in this robust light bread, each bringing out the unique flavors of the other. Be sure to use a quality beer to ensure a good result.

## Ingredients:

* 2 cups rye flour
* 1 1/2 cups room temperature beer
* 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
* 2 tablespoons white sugar
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 2 tablespoons shortening
* 1 egg
* 3 cups bread flour
* 1 tablespoon caraway seed (optional)
* 1 tablespoon cornmeal


## Directions:

1.  Combine rye flour, beer, and yeast in a large bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Set out overnight. Do not refrigerate.

1.  The next day, add sugar, salt, shortening, and egg; beat with mixer until smooth. Stir in caraway seeds, if wanted. Add enough white bread flour to make a soft dough.

1.  Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth, approximately 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, and turn to oil the surface of the dough. Let rise in warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled.

1.  Punch down dough, and divide in half. Shape into round or oblong loaves, and place on greased baking sheets sprinkled with corn meal. Let rise for 30 minutes.

1.  Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Cool on racks.
