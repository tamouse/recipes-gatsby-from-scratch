When this floated across my consciousness, I went "OMG I HAVE TO MAKE THIS".

Not dairy- or gluten-free as is.

## Ingredients

* 2 Vidalia Onions
* 4 tablespoons of butter (not DF)
* 1 1/2 cups of fine ground yellow or white cornmeal, I used yellow (GF?)
* 1 cup all purpose flour (not GF)
* 1 and 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1/3 cup white sugar
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 8 ounces frozen broccoli-thawed
* 1/2 cup cooked chopped bacon (optional)
* 4 eggs
* 16 ounces of cottage cheese (not DF)

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees
1. Slice the Vidalia Onions into rings leaving the rings in order if possible
1. Melt the butter in the cast iron skillet
1. Place the onion slices close together into the butter, fill in any spaces with smaller bits of onion
1. Finely chop any remaining Vidalia onion and reserve it.
1. Let the onions cook on medium heat for 5 minutes
1. While the onions are cooking mix the batter:
1. Add the cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in a bowl and stir to combine.
1. In a large bowl beat 4 eggs, mix in the cottage cheese
1. Squeeze the water out of the broccoli and mix this into the eggs. Add the reserved chopped onions
1. Add the cornmeal mix and stir to combine. (add optional bacon f you like)
1. Pour the batter over the onions
1. Bake the cornbread for 22-28 minutes or until done.
1. Let the cornbread cool for 10-15 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the cornbread.
1. Place a plate over the pan and using oven mitts carefully flip the pan over and remove the cornbread from the pan. BE CAREFUL, IT'S HOT.
