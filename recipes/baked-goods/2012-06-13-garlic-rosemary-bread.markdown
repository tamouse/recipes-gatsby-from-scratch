A great recipe for an artisan style bread with rosemary.

## Ingredients

* 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
* 2 cups bread flour
* 1 &frac14; cup warm water, divided
* 3 to 5 tbs olive oil
* 2 &frac12; tbs dry or fresh rosemary, crushed
* 5 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tbs active dry yeast
* 2 &frac12; tsp salt
* 2 &frac12; tsp sugar

## Instructions

1.  Mince the garlic and crush the dry rosemary or mince the fresh and place into a small bowl.

1.  Pour about a teaspoon of olive oil over the garlic and rosemary. Stir to moisten the dry rosemary (if using dry) or to coat the fresh rosemary and garlic. Set aside.

1.  Put &frac12; cup of water into a small bowl and warm to body temperature in the microwave.

1.  Sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir. Set aside.

1.  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook put the flour, salt and sugar.

1.  Turn the mixer on low and mix for about 1 minute.

1.  Measure &frac34; cup of water into another bowl and add 3 tablespoons of olive oil.

1.  Warm in the microwave to body temperature.

1.  Turn the mixer on low and add yeast and water. Mix for one minute.

1.  Pour the warm water and olive oil into the mixer and mix for about 2 minutes on low.

1.  Pour in the olive oil and herbs.

1.  Turn the mixer on medium low and knead with the dough hook for about 5 minutes.

1.  If the dough seems too wet add about a tablespoon of flour at a time to the bowl and continue to knead. If the dough seems too dry dribble about a teaspoon of olive oil into the bowl.

1.  Knead until smooth or about 8 to 10 minutes in total.

1.  Place the ball of dough into a greased bowl and set in a warm spot till it doubles in size, about 1 hour. I put the bowl in my oven with the light turned on.

1.  After the dough has risen punch down and divide in half.

1.  You can form the dough into two rounds or two small French bread loaves on a greased cookie sheet or a pizza stone sprinkled with cornmeal.

1.  Let loaves rise until doubled. About an hour.

1.  After the loaves have risen if you have been using your oven to keep them warm remove them from the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.

1.  Carefully brush some olive oil over the tops.

1.  Bake the loaves for 30 to 40 minutes or until the loaves sound hollow when you knock on the bottom.

1.  Cool on cooling racks.

1.  Cool completely before cutting.
