elvish bread


## Ingredients

* 2 1/2 cups of flour
* 1 tablespoon of baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon of salt
* 8 tablespoons of cold butter (1 stick)
* 1/3 cup of brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon of cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon maple syrup/honey
* 2/3 cup of milk/heavy cream (or more, if necessary)
* 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla


## Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 220 degrees Celcius (425 degrees Fahrenheit).
1.  Mix the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl.
1.  Add the butter and mix with a fork or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles fine granules.
1.  Add the sugar and cinnamon, and mix them thoroughly into the mixture.
1.  Add the milk/cream and vanilla and stir them in with a fork until a nice, thick dough forms.
1.  Roll the dough out about 1/2 in thickness.
1.  Cut out 3-inch squares and transfer the dough to a cookie sheet.
1.  Criss-cross (DO NOT cut all the way) each square from corner-to-corner with a knife.
1.  Bake for about 12 minutes or more (depending on the thickness of the bread) until it is set and lightly golden.

(the recipe makes about 10-12 pieces of lembas)
