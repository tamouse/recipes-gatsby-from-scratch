A friend introduced me to these, and they are spectacular as you might
imagine.

Not dairy-free with cheese.

## Ingredients

* 4 ounces manchego cheese, cut into 24 small cubes
* 24 dried pitted dates
* 8 slices bacon, cut into thirds
* 24 wooden toothpicks

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

2. Stuff 1 piece manchego cheese into each date and then wrap with 1
   piece bacon, securing with a toothpick.

3. Arrange dates in a shallow baking dish with the bacon seam down and
   1 inch between pieces.

4. Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes, turn dates with tongs, and
	continue baking until bacon is crisp, 5 to 6 minutes more.

5. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
