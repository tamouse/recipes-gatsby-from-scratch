Traditional Dim Sum treat from the StarTrib Taste section.

## Ingredients

###  Dumplings

* 2 tbsp. canola oil
* 1 lb. ground chicken (or use 1 lb. of uncooked shrimp, peeled and deveined and roughly chopped; dry the shrimp well before using.)
* 2 (8-oz.) cans water chestnuts, drained and roughly chopped
* 1/2 c. chopped green onions, including both green and white parts
* 1/4 c. oyster sauce
* 20 wonton wrappers
* 1 egg yolk mixed with 1 tsp. cornstarch

###  Ponzu Sauce

* 1 c. rice wine vinegar
* 1/4 c. soy sauce
* 1 tbsp. sugar
* 2 tbsp. orange juice
* 1/2 tbsp. chopped fresh ginger



## Directions

1.  In a 10-inch saut&eacute; pan, heat oil on medium. Let pan get hot, until the oil shimmers. Add the chicken and saut&eacute; for about 2 minutes, until almost done cooking. (If using shrimp, cook until the flesh is just pink.) Stir in water chestnuts, green onions and oyster sauce. Taste and add salt if necessary. Transfer to bowl and let cool in the refrigerator. (Mixture must be entirely cool before you fill the wrappers.)

1.  Scoop a teaspoon of filling into center of a wonton wrapper. Paint the edges of the wrapper with the egg and cornstarch mixture, which acts as a "glue" to keep the dumpling sealed.

1.  Fold wrapper on a diagonal, forming a triangle. To seal wrapper, start from one corner and slowly press your way all around. Avoid trapping air inside. Repeat with all wrappers. Set dumplings aside.

1.  Bring a 2-quart pot of water to a boil. Drop in a few dumplings at a time. They will sink to bottom, and as soon as they float, they're done. Pull them out with a slotted spoon and drain them on a plate. Don't use paper towels on the plate because they will stick to the dumplings. Wipe plate of excess water.

1.  In a small bowl, combine vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, orange juice and ginger to make ponzu sauce. Serve dumplings with sauce on side.
