Ganked from the savorystyle blog, these bombs look amazing!

## Ingredients

* 2 cups leftover and chilled Mashed Potatoes
* Bacon..one slice per Bomb
* 1 Egg
* 1/2 cup Dry Bread Crumbs
* Cheddar Cheese cut into 1" chunks (one chunk per Bomb)
* Salt and Pepper to taste
* Skewers or toothpicks
* Oil for frying -- canola
* Sour Cream and toppings for dipping


## Directions

1. In a large bowl combine the Mashed Potatoes, Egg, and S&P until well blended.

2. Grab a small scoop of the Mashed Potatoes and gently form it around a Cheddar Chunkâ€¦

3. Place the Bread Crumbs into a shallow bowl, and roll that baby evenly in the Bread Crumbs. Fry them up in the oil (350 degrees, until they're evenly golden)

4. Let the drain on some paper towel.

5. Serve them with Sour Cream, and serve them warm so they explode!
