One of my mom's favourite foods.

## Ingredients

* 16 saltine crackers, finely crushed
* 2 tablespoons water
* 1 pound flaked cooked crabmeat
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1 tablespoon prepared mustard
* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
* 1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay), paprika
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon black pepper
 
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil for frying

## Directions

1.  Stir the cracker crumbs and water together in a mixing bowl. Let stand 1 minute to soften the crackers. Add the crabmeat, egg, mustard, and mayonnaise. Season with Worcestershire sauce, seafood seasoning, salt, and black pepper; stir until evenly mixed.

1.  Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Form the crab mixture into patties 3/4-inch thick. Cook in the hot oil until golden brown on each side and hot in the center, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.
