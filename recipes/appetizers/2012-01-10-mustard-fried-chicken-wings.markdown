Spicy, mustardy, fried chicken wings

> "Chicken wings are seasoned with a delicate mixture of spices, then
  coated in mustard and floured before being fried until crisp. If you
  don't have a deep-fryer, you may use a heavy skillet, but for
  crispier chicken, I would prefer a deep-fryer. This chicken is SO
  good!"



## Ingredients

* 5 pounds chicken wings,separated at joints, tips discarded
* 1 tablespoon seasoned salt
* 2 tablespoons garlic powder
* 2 tablespoons onion powder
* 2 tablespoons ground black pepper
* 2 tablespoons paprika
* 3 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 quart oil for frying, or as needed


## Directions
1. Season the chicken wings on both sides by sprinkling with seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. Coat each piece with a thin layer of mustard. Put the flour into a plastic bag, add the chicken, and shake to coat.

1. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or deep heavy skillet to 350&degF; (175&degC). When the oil is hot, add the chicken in small batches and cook for 6 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear. Drain on paper towels, and cool for 5 minutes before serving.
