Yet another nacho recipe, this time with sweet potatoes!!

## Ingredients

-  2 large sweet potatoes, sliced 1/4 inch thick
-  1 Tbsp. olive oil
-  1 tsp. paprika
-  1 tsp. garlic powder
-  salt and pepper, to taste
-  1 cup canned black beans, rinsed
-  1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
-  1/4 cup chopped green onions
-  1 avocado, diced or smashed
-  Greek yogurt or sour cream
-  Salsa

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425F and lightly spray a baking sheet with cooking
spray.

2. Wash and dry your sweet potatoes, then use a vegetable peeler to
peel them. Slice them into 1/4 inch rounds and place in a large
bowl. Drizzle with olive oil, using your hands to ensure that each
round is evenly coated. Season with paprika, garlic powder, and salt
and pepper, tossing well.

3. Place rounds in a single layer on your baking sheet. Bake for 40
minutes, turning them over halfway through to ensure they don't burn.

4. Remove from oven and transfer rounds to a cast iron skillet or oven
safe dish, allowing the edges to slightly overlap. Top with beans and
cheese before returning to the oven for an additional 5 minutes, or
until cheese is melted.

5. Remove from oven and sprinkle with chopped green onions. Serve with
avocado, Greek yogurt or sour cream, and salsa.
