This is a fantastic appetizer recipe gleaned from an advertising
circular. The ad called for using Karo syrup, which I omitted quite
readily.


## Ingredients

- 8 ounces bacon
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 medium sweet onion, chopped
- 1 medium red onion, chopped
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 1 cup sour cream
- 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 2 cups shredded Monterey jack cheese
- 1/4 cup chopped green onions for garnish 

## Directions

1. Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until
crisp. Drain on paper towels and crumble. Drain all but 2 tablespoons
of bacon grease from pan.

2. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in skillet and add onions. Stir gently
and cook until [carmelized](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/scocca/2012/05/how_to_cook_onions_why_recipe_writers_lie_and_lie_about_how_long_they_take_to_caramelize_.single.html).

3. Add vinegar and bacon, mix well and remove from heat.

4. Combine cream cheese and sour cream stirring to blend well.

5. Stir in 1 1/2 cups shredded cheese, bacon and onions, mixing well.

6. Pour mixture into a greased 1 quart baking dish (I used an 8-inch
pie plate which worked quite well). Top with remaining cheese.

7. Bake in pre-heated oven at 350&#x2109; for 15 to 20 minutes until
cheese is bubbly.

8. Top with green onions.
